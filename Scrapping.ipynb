Cities are acting as engines of economic growth and modernization as they become more technologically advanced, considerably accelerating the trajectory of <strong>global development</strong>. Technology has had nothing short of revolutionary effects on Indian cities, ushering in a new era of change and advancement. India’s <strong>metropolitan centers</strong> have embraced technology in ways that are transforming the fundamental fabric of urban life, from infrastructure to governance and beyond, as the world rushes into the digital age.</p>\n",
       "<p>India’s cities must play a crucial part if the nation is to develop into a worldwide economic powerhouse. One of the world’s economies with the greatest growth rates, India aims to reach US$5 trillion in <strong>GDP</strong> by 2026 and US$40 trillion by 2047, the year it will celebrate 100 years of independence. The idea of smart cities is one of technology’s most obvious effects. Indian cities are progressively implementing cutting-edge technologies to build effective, linked urban landscapes. To improve the quality of life for people, smart cities use data analytics, the <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong>, and <strong>automation</strong>. <strong>Smart traffic management solutions</strong>, for instance, improve traffic flow while lowering congestion and air pollution. Sensor-based garbage collection improves waste management, resulting in cleaner and healthier settings.</p>\n",
       "<p>To become a major player in the world economy, however, several steps are being followed. A crucial one relates to India’s ongoing urbanization development. Between 1970 and 2018, the population of Indian cities is predicted to have expanded from 109 million to 460 million, nearly a fourfold increase.</p>\n",
       "<ol type=\"1\">\n",
       "<li>The nation, which already has the second-largest urban population in the world, is predicted to have a 50% urban population share by 2050 after adding 416 million residents to its cities.</li>\n",
       "<li>4 Cities are the centers of economic growth and innovation because they are home to innovative businesses, better-paying employment, and important institutions. (Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai)</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>Cities foster increased productivity through several routes, generally known as <strong>agglomeration economies</strong>, by permitting close contact between businesses and employees. The theory’s main consequence is that businesses in bigger and/or denser cities should be more productive. In the year 2035, urbanization has had a significant impact on both India and the rest of the world. India now boasts the third-largest economy in the world, only behind China and the United States. In this new period, China has already exceeded the USA in terms of economic size, while India has surpassed Japan to claim a higher place. Although India has 675 million people living in urbanized cities, China has a stunning one billion people living in urbanized cities.</p>\n",
       "<p>Urbanization has both advantages and disadvantages, including financial expenditures. Although city growth can result in better possibilities and a higher standard of living, it also presents difficulties and issues. Rapid urbanization has the potential to deplete resources, harm the environment, and worsen <strong>socioeconomic</strong> inequities. Depending on how well these problems are solved, urbanization will either have a favorable or negative overall effect.</p>\n",
       "<p>With more than half of the world’s population now living in cities, urbanization has emerged as a major force for development. But it also presents fresh difficulties and chances, reshaping the planet and our way of life in unexpected ways. A future where <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is increasingly pervasive and has an impact on many parts of our daily lives has been ushered in by this shift. Urbanization has improved living conditions and economic opportunities, but it also calls for careful management and sustainable practices to guarantee a bright and prosperous future for everybody.</p>\n",
       "<p>Similarly, to this, a nation’s population and demography can contribute significantly to its growth. India’s rapidly rising working-age population will be in its favor, and the nation is expected to host some of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the years to come. The West is also taken aback by the annual GDP growth rate of the cities that are predicted to top the charts. Aside from a few towns in Southeast Asia, all of the cities are now from the Asian bloc, which is primarily controlled by India and China. Bangalore, which has had an enormous 8.5 percent GDP growth, is in first place, followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore’s startup culture and enormous skill pool set it apart from other cities. Bangalore itself is probably going to be <strong>the future Silicon Valley</strong> of Asia and the entire world. It currently creates a tremendous number of startups. It has the potential to rank among the world’s most urbanized cities. These cities will outpace the global average yearly GDP growth rate, which is expected to be about 2.5%, by a sizeable margin.</p>\n",
       "<p>Undoubtedly, nations will expand and cities will modernize to meet societal demands. Urban city growth has mostly been attributed to rural-to-urban migration. However, the future will be better for us and our offspring if we can maintain a balance between the environment and sustainable growth. We are being impacted by climate change, which is real. In large areas, the effects of climate change will harm the environment through prolonged heat waves, more irregular rainfall, drought, and flooding.</p>\n",
       "<p>As we can see in Pakistan, China, and Europe. Europe as a whole has seen heat waves that have disrupted society, and China is currently dealing with extreme heat waves that are drying up the rivers and making it impossible to produce hydroelectricity. In Pakistan, there were an unusually high number of floods. Out of 160 districts, 110 are underwater, representing a loss of roughly $10 billion.  <strong>Rural agrarian and pastoralist types of society</strong>, which heavily rely on the environment, are severely impacted by these effects. Climate-driven migration is projected to rise as livelihoods all around the world are affected more and more by climate change.</p>\n",
       "<p>The broader prospects of regional environments are likewise impacted by urbanization. Large increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the frequency of days with thunderstorms are also observed in areas that are downwind from large industrial complexes. Urban regions produce more precipitation, but they also have less water filtration, which lowers the water tables. Urban areas consume significantly more energy than rural communities do for heating, cooking, transportation, and electricity. For instance, today’s metropolitan populations have more cars than rural ones.</p>\n",
       "<p>Due to technology, both healthcare and education are going through significant changes. By extending access to high-quality education outside the walls of traditional classrooms, online education platforms are <strong>democratizing learning</strong>. Remote places are now being reached by telemedicine, which allows doctors to diagnose and treat patients at a distance and close healthcare gaps. These advancements are essential in a large, varied nation like India where achieving fair access to healthcare and education has historically proven difficult.</p>\n",
       "<p>The effect of technology on job trends is another factor to take into account. Technology opens up new possibilities, but it also challenges established employment positions, raising concerns about job displacement and the need for skill upgrading. To ensure that no one is left behind in the wake of these changes, it is essential to strike a balance between technological advancement and social welfare.</p>\n",
       "<p>Technology also stimulates economic development and entrepreneurship. A wider audience can now be reached by small enterprises thanks to the growth of digital platforms, promoting economic inclusion. The <strong>gig economy</strong> is altering established labor patterns and creating new employment opportunities as a result of technology-driven platforms. In tech centers like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune, startups are thriving and fostering innovation in a variety of industries.</p>\n",
       "<p>However, the rapid advancement of technology also creates problems and worries. Urbanization and technology improvements have given rise to problems like the <strong>digital divide and data privacy worries</strong>. Technology benefits major cities, while rural populations struggle to get even the most basic digital services, escalating disparities. Additionally, concerns regarding data security and privacy are raised by our growing reliance on technology. Protecting personal information becomes more important as more areas of urban life are digitalized.</p>\n",
       "<p>In conclusion, technology is permanently changing Indian cities, transforming them into vibrant, connected, and effective urban hubs. Due to technology breakthroughs, smart cities, e-governance, education, healthcare, and entrepreneurship are all seeing substantial improvements. These adjustments, though, come with obligations. To close the digital divide, safeguard the privacy of citizen data, and guarantee that the advantages of technology are dispersed fairly, policymakers must collaborate. India’s cities have the ability to lead the way in innovation, progress, and inclusivity in the twenty-first century if they can fully realize their potential and overcome their issues.</p>\n",

      "Throughout history, from the industrial revolution in the 18th century through the development of the Internet, technology has been the primary driver of societal change. It has aided in turning cities into smart urban centers that provide more opportunities and improvements in quality of life. It continues to play a crucial role in altering the world. Cities are acting as engines of economic growth and modernization as they become more technologically advanced, considerably accelerating the trajectory of global development. Technology has had nothing short of revolutionary effects on Indian cities, ushering in a new era of change and advancement. India’s metropolitan centers have embraced technology in ways that are transforming the fundamental fabric of urban life, from infrastructure to governance and beyond, as the world rushes into the digital age.\n",
      "India’s cities must play a crucial part if the nation is to develop into a worldwide economic powerhouse. One of the world’s economies with the greatest growth rates, India aims to reach US$5 trillion in GDP by 2026 and US$40 trillion by 2047, the year it will celebrate 100 years of independence. The idea of smart cities is one of technology’s most obvious effects. Indian cities are progressively implementing cutting-edge technologies to build effective, linked urban landscapes. To improve the quality of life for people, smart cities use data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation. Smart traffic management solutions, for instance, improve traffic flow while lowering congestion and air pollution. Sensor-based garbage collection improves waste management, resulting in cleaner and healthier settings.\n",
      "To become a major player in the world economy, however, several steps are being followed. A crucial one relates to India’s ongoing urbanization development. Between 1970 and 2018, the population of Indian cities is predicted to have expanded from 109 million to 460 million, nearly a fourfold increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nation, which already has the second-largest urban population in the world, is predicted to have a 50% urban population share by 2050 after adding 416 million residents to its cities.\n",
      "4 Cities are the centers of economic growth and innovation because they are home to innovative businesses, better-paying employment, and important institutions. (Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cities foster increased productivity through several routes, generally known as agglomeration economies, by permitting close contact between businesses and employees. The theory’s main consequence is that businesses in bigger and/or denser cities should be more productive. In the year 2035, urbanization has had a significant impact on both India and the rest of the world. India now boasts the third-largest economy in the world, only behind China and the United States. In this new period, China has already exceeded the USA in terms of economic size, while India has surpassed Japan to claim a higher place. Although India has 675 million people living in urbanized cities, China has a stunning one billion people living in urbanized cities.\n",
      "Urbanization has both advantages and disadvantages, including financial expenditures. Although city growth can result in better possibilities and a higher standard of living, it also presents difficulties and issues. Rapid urbanization has the potential to deplete resources, harm the environment, and worsen socioeconomic inequities. Depending on how well these problems are solved, urbanization will either have a favorable or negative overall effect.\n",
      "With more than half of the world’s population now living in cities, urbanization has emerged as a major force for development. But it also presents fresh difficulties and chances, reshaping the planet and our way of life in unexpected ways. A future where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly pervasive and has an impact on many parts of our daily lives has been ushered in by this shift. Urbanization has improved living conditions and economic opportunities, but it also calls for careful management and sustainable practices to guarantee a bright and prosperous future for everybody.\n",
      "Similarly, to this, a nation’s population and demography can contribute significantly to its growth. India’s rapidly rising working-age population will be in its favor, and the nation is expected to host some of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the years to come. The West is also taken aback by the annual GDP growth rate of the cities that are predicted to top the charts. Aside from a few towns in Southeast Asia, all of the cities are now from the Asian bloc, which is primarily controlled by India and China. Bangalore, which has had an enormous 8.5 percent GDP growth, is in first place, followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore’s startup culture and enormous skill pool set it apart from other cities. Bangalore itself is probably going to be the future Silicon Valley of Asia and the entire world. It currently creates a tremendous number of startups. It has the potential to rank among the world’s most urbanized cities. These cities will outpace the global average yearly GDP growth rate, which is expected to be about 2.5%, by a sizeable margin.\n",
      "Undoubtedly, nations will expand and cities will modernize to meet societal demands. Urban city growth has mostly been attributed to rural-to-urban migration. However, the future will be better for us and our offspring if we can maintain a balance between the environment and sustainable growth. We are being impacted by climate change, which is real. In large areas, the effects of climate change will harm the environment through prolonged heat waves, more irregular rainfall, drought, and flooding.\n",
      "As we can see in Pakistan, China, and Europe. Europe as a whole has seen heat waves that have disrupted society, and China is currently dealing with extreme heat waves that are drying up the rivers and making it impossible to produce hydroelectricity. In Pakistan, there were an unusually high number of floods. Out of 160 districts, 110 are underwater, representing a loss of roughly $10 billion.  Rural agrarian and pastoralist types of society, which heavily rely on the environment, are severely impacted by these effects. Climate-driven migration is projected to rise as livelihoods all around the world are affected more and more by climate change.\n",
      "The broader prospects of regional environments are likewise impacted by urbanization. Large increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the frequency of days with thunderstorms are also observed in areas that are downwind from large industrial complexes. Urban regions produce more precipitation, but they also have less water filtration, which lowers the water tables. Urban areas consume significantly more energy than rural communities do for heating, cooking, transportation, and electricity. For instance, today’s metropolitan populations have more cars than rural ones.\n",
      "Due to technology, both healthcare and education are going through significant changes. By extending access to high-quality education outside the walls of traditional classrooms, online education platforms are democratizing learning. Remote places are now being reached by telemedicine, which allows doctors to diagnose and treat patients at a distance and close healthcare gaps. These advancements are essential in a large, varied nation like India where achieving fair access to healthcare and education has historically proven difficult.\n",
      "The effect of technology on job trends is another factor to take into account. Technology opens up new possibilities, but it also challenges established employment positions, raising concerns about job displacement and the need for skill upgrading. To ensure that no one is left behind in the wake of these changes, it is essential to strike a balance between technological advancement and social welfare.\n",
      "Technology also stimulates economic development and entrepreneurship. A wider audience can now be reached by small enterprises thanks to the growth of digital platforms, promoting economic inclusion. The gig economy is altering established labor patterns and creating new employment opportunities as a result of technology-driven platforms. In tech centers like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune, startups are thriving and fostering innovation in a variety of industries.\n",
      "However, the rapid advancement of technology also creates problems and worries. Urbanization and technology improvements have given rise to problems like the digital divide and data privacy worries. Technology benefits major cities, while rural populations struggle to get even the most basic digital services, escalating disparities. Additionally, concerns regarding data security and privacy are raised by our growing reliance on technology. Protecting personal information becomes more important as more areas of urban life are digitalized.\n",
      "In conclusion, technology is permanently changing Indian cities, transforming them into vibrant, connected, and effective urban hubs. Due to technology breakthroughs, smart cities, e-governance, education, healthcare, and entrepreneurship are all seeing substantial improvements. These adjustments, though, come with obligations. To close the digital divide, safeguard the privacy of citizen data, and guarantee that the advantages of technology are dispersed fairly, policymakers must collaborate. India’s cities have the ability to lead the way in innovation, progress, and inclusivity in the twenty-first century if they can fully realize their potential and overcome their issues.\n",

Bengaluru has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kolkata:- Kolkata in West Bengal is an emerging major IT hub. The new Kolkata i.e. Saltlake Sector  5, New town, Rajarhat area of Kolkata is a major IT hub. The government is giving the software companies land at almost free of cost to set up the companies there. Many large companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Infosys and others have set up their companies here. Kolkata has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy.\n",
      "Impact on Economy\n",
      "There is a huge impact of the rising IT cities on our economy. Some of the effects are-\n",
      "\n",
      "Demand:- The rising IT cities will greatly help to boost our economy. These will create a huge demand for raw materials. The products when ready will be a huge demand for the people too.\n",
      "Supply:-– Supply means the fulfilment of demand. In a large and highly populous country like India, there is always a demand for finished products. If more IT cities do not develop, the companies cannot fulfil the needs and desires of the people of a populous country like India. As IT cities develop, more IT companies will come, which will supply more and more finished IT products to our people.\n",
      "Market: A market is a place where different economic agents like buyers and sellers interact with one another. In a populous country like India, there is a huge market. As IT cities will grow, more and more IT companies will come from across the world and more will the competition in the market increase. This will help consumers as they will get more and more differentiated products and the market will also run smoothly. A competitive market is always good and healthy. We can safely assume that our oligopoly market will surely tend to reach a perfectly competitive market by the year 2040.\n",
      "Revenue:- As the market increases, more revenue will be generated. Now at present, the IT revenue of India is 245 million dollars, 19 million dollars more than the financial year 2022. If IT cities grow, then more companies will invest which leads to an increase in the IT market which in turn generates more revenue in India. We can expect that the IT revenue of India will cross or nearly tend to reach 10 billion dollars by 2040.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impact on Environment\n",
      "The rising IT cities will create a huge impact on the environment, the maximum of which will be harmful effects. The impact of rising IT cities on the environment is-\n",
      "\n",
      "Deforestation:- There will be cutting of trees in huge numbers to make the building of the IT companies which will cause great harm to the environment. The cutting of trees on a large scale will also cause mass degradation of forests.\n",
      "More carbon footprint:- The IT companies will generate more carbon footprint in the atmosphere. South Asian countries including India are known for their lower carbon footprint. But if the IT sector grows this way then we will also be at the same pace of generation of carbon footprint by 2040.\n",
      "Death of birds:- The cell phone and mobile towers by the telecom companies caused the death of birds which caused a great imbalance in the ecosystem. The number of sparrows has been reduced due to this phenomenon. If this goes on we can see the extinction of many bird species by 2040.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impact on infrastructure\n",
      "There are many contributions of the IT cities on infrastructure.  They are-\n",
      "\n",
      "Transportation:- The rising IT cities need an excellent transport system for the supply of raw materials and delivery of the finished products into the market. So the transportation system develops in that area. So we have an excellent transport system by 2040.\n",
      "Need for a public transport system:- There is a need for a public transport system in the IT cities. As the IT cities are a source of employment and a huge population reside in these areas, there is an adequate need for public transport systems like buses, taxis etc. We hope that it will be improved by 2040.\n",
      "Water supply:- As a huge number of people reside in the IT cities there is a need for adequate water supply to fulfil the needs of people as well as for industries. This will help us to find many new methods of water supply and conservation by 2040.\n",
      "Electricity:- Electric supply is the lifeline of the sector. Without an electric supply, no machines will run and not even the IT cities will flourish. If the IT cities flourish this way, we going to have an excellent electric supply by 2040.\n",
      "Healthcare:- As a large number of people reside in IT cities, there is a need for proper health infrastructure and healthcare facilities for the people. So with the growth of IT cities, our healthcare system will also improve by 2040.\n",
      "Education:- Education is the primary key or core of any nation. There must be proper education and training centres in those IT cities to fulfil the people’s demands.  So with the growth of IT cities, the education system will also develop by 2040. Our education is also going to be skill-oriented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impact on city life\n",
      "With the growth of IT cities, more people will get jobs and will earn more. So the purchasing power of the people will increase. People will lead a better lifestyle.

      "Text of the URL :  \n",
      "Throughout history, from the industrial revolution in the 18th century through the development of the Internet, technology has been the primary driver of societal change. It has aided in turning cities into smart urban centers that provide more opportunities and improvements in quality of life. It continues to play a crucial role in altering the world. Cities are acting as engines of economic growth and modernization as they become more technologically advanced, considerably accelerating the trajectory of global development. Technology has had nothing short of revolutionary effects on Indian cities, ushering in a new era of change and advancement. India’s metropolitan centers have embraced technology in ways that are transforming the fundamental fabric of urban life, from infrastructure to governance and beyond, as the world rushes into the digital age.\n",
      "India’s cities must play a crucial part if the nation is to develop into a worldwide economic powerhouse. One of the world’s economies with the greatest growth rates, India aims to reach US$5 trillion in GDP by 2026 and US$40 trillion by 2047, the year it will celebrate 100 years of independence. The idea of smart cities is one of technology’s most obvious effects. Indian cities are progressively implementing cutting-edge technologies to build effective, linked urban landscapes. To improve the quality of life for people, smart cities use data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation. Smart traffic management solutions, for instance, improve traffic flow while lowering congestion and air pollution. Sensor-based garbage collection improves waste management, resulting in cleaner and healthier settings.\n",
      "To become a major player in the world economy, however, several steps are being followed. A crucial one relates to India’s ongoing urbanization development. Between 1970 and 2018, the population of Indian cities is predicted to have expanded from 109 million to 460 million, nearly a fourfold increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nation, which already has the second-largest urban population in the world, is predicted to have a 50% urban population share by 2050 after adding 416 million residents to its cities.\n",
      "4 Cities are the centers of economic growth and innovation because they are home to innovative businesses, better-paying employment, and important institutions. (Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cities foster increased productivity through several routes, generally known as agglomeration economies, by permitting close contact between businesses and employees. The theory’s main consequence is that businesses in bigger and/or denser cities should be more productive. In the year 2035, urbanization has had a significant impact on both India and the rest of the world. India now boasts the third-largest economy in the world, only behind China and the United States. In this new period, China has already exceeded the USA in terms of economic size, while India has surpassed Japan to claim a higher place. Although India has 675 million people living in urbanized cities, China has a stunning one billion people living in urbanized cities.\n",
      "Urbanization has both advantages and disadvantages, including financial expenditures. Although city growth can result in better possibilities and a higher standard of living, it also presents difficulties and issues. Rapid urbanization has the potential to deplete resources, harm the environment, and worsen socioeconomic inequities. Depending on how well these problems are solved, urbanization will either have a favorable or negative overall effect.\n",
      "With more than half of the world’s population now living in cities, urbanization has emerged as a major force for development. But it also presents fresh difficulties and chances, reshaping the planet and our way of life in unexpected ways. A future where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly pervasive and has an impact on many parts of our daily lives has been ushered in by this shift. Urbanization has improved living conditions and economic opportunities, but it also calls for careful management and sustainable practices to guarantee a bright and prosperous future for everybody.\n",
      "Similarly, to this, a nation’s population and demography can contribute significantly to its growth. India’s rapidly rising working-age population will be in its favor, and the nation is expected to host some of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the years to come. The West is also taken aback by the annual GDP growth rate of the cities that are predicted to top the charts. Aside from a few towns in Southeast Asia, all of the cities are now from the Asian bloc, which is primarily controlled by India and China. Bangalore, which has had an enormous 8.5 percent GDP growth, is in first place, followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore’s startup culture and enormous skill pool set it apart from other cities. Bangalore itself is probably going to be the future Silicon Valley of Asia and the entire world. It currently creates a tremendous number of startups. It has the potential to rank among the world’s most urbanized cities. These cities will outpace the global average yearly GDP growth rate, which is expected to be about 2.5%, by a sizeable margin.\n",
      "Undoubtedly, nations will expand and cities will modernize to meet societal demands. Urban city growth has mostly been attributed to rural-to-urban migration. However, the future will be better for us and our offspring if we can maintain a balance between the environment and sustainable growth. We are being impacted by climate change, which is real. In large areas, the effects of climate change will harm the environment through prolonged heat waves, more irregular rainfall, drought, and flooding.\n",
      "As we can see in Pakistan, China, and Europe. Europe as a whole has seen heat waves that have disrupted society, and China is currently dealing with extreme heat waves that are drying up the rivers and making it impossible to produce hydroelectricity. In Pakistan, there were an unusually high number of floods. Out of 160 districts, 110 are underwater, representing a loss of roughly $10 billion.  Rural agrarian and pastoralist types of society, which heavily rely on the environment, are severely impacted by these effects. Climate-driven migration is projected to rise as livelihoods all around the world are affected more and more by climate change.\n",
      "The broader prospects of regional environments are likewise impacted by urbanization. Large increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the frequency of days with thunderstorms are also observed in areas that are downwind from large industrial complexes. Urban regions produce more precipitation, but they also have less water filtration, which lowers the water tables. Urban areas consume significantly more energy than rural communities do for heating, cooking, transportation, and electricity. For instance, today’s metropolitan populations have more cars than rural ones.\n",
      "Due to technology, both healthcare and education are going through significant changes. By extending access to high-quality education outside the walls of traditional classrooms, online education platforms are democratizing learning. Remote places are now being reached by telemedicine, which allows doctors to diagnose and treat patients at a distance and close healthcare gaps. These advancements are essential in a large, varied nation like India where achieving fair access to healthcare and education has historically proven difficult.\n",
      "The effect of technology on job trends is another factor to take into account. Technology opens up new possibilities, but it also challenges established employment positions, raising concerns about job displacement and the need for skill upgrading. To ensure that no one is left behind in the wake of these changes, it is essential to strike a balance between technological advancement and social welfare.\n",
      "Technology also stimulates economic development and entrepreneurship. A wider audience can now be reached by small enterprises thanks to the growth of digital platforms, promoting economic inclusion. The gig economy is altering established labor patterns and creating new employment opportunities as a result of technology-driven platforms. In tech centers like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune, startups are thriving and fostering innovation in a variety of industries.\n",
      "However, the rapid advancement of technology also creates problems and worries. Urbanization and technology improvements have given rise to problems like the digital divide and data privacy worries. Technology benefits major cities, while rural populations struggle to get even the most basic digital services, escalating disparities. Additionally, concerns regarding data security and privacy are raised by our growing reliance on technology. Protecting personal information becomes more important as more areas of urban life are digitalized.\n",
      "In conclusion, technology is permanently changing Indian cities, transforming them into vibrant, connected, and effective urban hubs. Due to technology breakthroughs, smart cities, e-governance, education, healthcare, and entrepreneurship are all seeing substantial improvements. These adjustments, though, come with obligations. To close the digital divide, safeguard the privacy of citizen data, and guarantee that the advantages of technology are dispersed fairly, policymakers must collaborate. India’s cities have the ability to lead the way in innovation, progress, and inclusivity in the twenty-first century if they can fully realize their potential and overcome their issues.\n",

      "The way we live, work, and communicate has unquestionably changed as a result of the rapid evolution of technology. However, as we gain from digitization, we also leave ourselves vulnerable to cybercrime, a more sinister aspect of innovation. Cybercrime is a worrisome issue that has grown over time, and by the year 2040, its impacts are expected to be considerably more dangerous. This article examines the growing problem of cybercrime and its potentially wide-ranging effects, looking at how it may affect people, businesses, and even countries.\n",
      "Cybercrime, which frequently involves illicit online behaviour, includes a variety of offences like hacking, identity theft, phishing, ransomware attacks, and more. The digital revolution of several industries, including finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, has unintentionally given cybercriminals a larger attack surface to find flaws and steal sensitive data. According to experts, cybercrime will have increased in frequency and sophistication by 2040. Cybercriminals will have additional opportunities to compromise networks and steal data as a result of cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n",
      "Cyberattack complexity is predicted to reach previously unheard-of heights by 2040.

Identity theft is anticipated to become more sophisticated by 2040 when thieves can obtain personal data from numerous sources using AI and machine learning techniques.\n",
      "Healthcare Sector’s Exposure:\n",
      "Due to the sensitivity of patient data and the vital role it plays in society, the healthcare industry has emerged as a top target for hackers. By 2040, the integration of medical devices with digital systems may reveal weaknesses that would make it possible for cybercriminals to alter medical records, steal patient treatments, or even compromise personal health information.\n",
      "Threats to national security:\n",
      "Unprecedented threats to national security are posed by cyberattacks on vital infrastructure, including power grids, transportation networks, and communication networks. Such strikes might have disastrous effects by 2040, upsetting entire countries and unleashing an unprecedented level of turmoil. National security is no longer limited to conventional military threats in the digital age. The field of cyberwarfare will have grown greatly by 2040. Nations might become embroiled in cyber warfare, which might result in data manipulation, espionage, and even virtual sabotage. Cyberattacks have the potential to disrupt political landscapes, undermine defence systems, and impair military communication.\n",
      "Disruption of Critical Infrastructure:\n",
      "Cyberattacks on vital infrastructure, such as power grids, transportation networks, and healthcare institutions, may increase by the year 2040. Due to their interconnectedness with the internet, these systems are more vulnerable to prospective hacks, which might hurt entire societies. These assaults could jeopardise crucial services, healthcare, and public safety.\n",
      "Surveillance and the erosion of privacy:\n",
      "The degradation of individual privacy worsens as technology develops. By 2040, a complex network of interconnected gadgets may enable new levels of data collection and surveillance, raising questions about civil liberties and individual freedoms. Governments, businesses, and even cybercriminals could make use of this circumstance for a variety of reasons, including social engineering and extortion.\n",
      "International Relations Restructuring:\n",
      "Beyond national borders, the prevalence of cybercrime can alter global relations. States might interfere with elections, steal intellectual property, and engage in cyber espionage, all of which would exacerbate an already tense situation by sowing distrust and uncertainty. As countries struggle with concerns of cyber sovereignty and digital security, diplomacy may transcend beyond traditional channels and into the domain of cyber talks.\n",
      "Interventions by the government and the law:\n",
      "To prevent cybercriminals and hold them accountable, governments must implement strict laws and regulatory structures. Cyber rules that encourage responsible behaviour in cyberspace must be established through international collaboration and diplomatic efforts.\n",
      "Developing Countermeasures:\n",
      "The fight for digital security becomes more intense as criminality increases. The creation of countermeasures will be essential by 2040 for protecting sensitive data and crucial systems. Businesses and governments will make significant investments in cybersecurity research, AI-driven threat detection, and preventative defence systems. Robust cybersecurity frameworks will develop as a result of the merging of human expertise with machine learning.\n",
      "Social Effects and Mental Health Costs:\n",
      "The development of cybercrime is expected to have a significant social impact on people’s personal and psychological well-being. The ongoing risk of financial loss, data breaches, and digital manipulation may reduce public confidence in digital systems. Living in a constantly unstable digital environment can have a psychological toll that heightens stress, worry, and a lack of faith in technology’s promises.\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "The development of cybercrime and its probable consequences by 2040 provides a gloomy perspective on the difficulties that lie ahead as we look into the future. While technological development has revolutionised our way of life, it has also ushered in a new period of criminal activities. Governments, corporations, and individuals must work together to combat these risks through thorough cybersecurity measures, global collaboration, and responsible technological development. We can work to guarantee a digital future that supports the principles of privacy, trust, and creativity by recognising the scope of the threat, investing in state-of-the-art defence systems, and encouraging a culture of cyber alertness. The battle against the shadowy side of the digital revolution is ongoing, as symbolised by the hashtags #SecureDigitalFuture and #CybercrimeBattle.\n",

      "Text of the URL :  \n",
      "The year 2040 is poised to witness a continued revolution in the world of entertainment, driven by the meteoric rise of Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms. These digital content hubs have already reshaped how we consume media today, and their impact is set to be even more profound in the coming years. The emergence of OTT platforms and their far-reaching effects on the entertainment industry is really going to be very huge one day.\n",
      "The entertainment landscape has undergone a seismic shift with the rise of Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms, and by the year 2040, their influence will have reshaped the industry in profound ways. This article delves into the trajectory of OTT platforms and their far-reaching effects on the entertainment ecosystem.\n",
      " By 2040, OTT platforms will solidify their status as the dominant players in the entertainment realm. With accessible internet connectivity, audiences from all corners of the globe can access a vast array of content, transcending the geographical boundaries.\n",
      " OTT platforms have democratized content creation, enabling a diverse range of creators to showcase their work. This will lead to an explosion of niche content, catering to specific interests and cultures that were previously under-represented.\n",
      "Also there has been a lot of Shift in the Consumption Habits of the audiences. Traditional television will continue to lose ground as consumers opt for personalized viewing experiences on OTT platforms. Linear programming will wane as audiences favour on-demand content that fits their schedules and interests.\n",
      "OTT platforms will become hubs for original content production. Exclusive movies, series, and documentaries will attract A-list talent, further blurring the line between cinema and streaming.\n",
      "OTT Platforms also gives one Interactive and Immersive Experience to the audience. With advancements in augmented and virtual reality, OTT platforms may offer immersive viewing experiences, transforming how audiences engage with the content available on the OTT Platforms.\n",
      "OTTs give you Data-Driven Insights. Like if you have watched a Thriller web series it will keep on recommending you all the trending thriller shows streaming on that particular platform. The streaming nature of OTT platforms enables data collection that can inform content creation. Viewer preferences and trends will influence the types of content produced, enhancing user satisfaction.\n",
      "I believe that the rise of OTT may disrupt traditional advertising models also. Advertisers will adapt to targeted, non-intrusive advertising methods, challenging the decades-old commercial break format. I mentioned the word may, because the advertisements said by the OTT platforms say that “if you take a subscription then you won’t be seeing the advertisement. Hence here this is not a sure shot case that is going to happen.\n",
      "Rising of different OTT Platforms is also going to Impact on Theatrical Releases.Theatrical releases might experience changes, with some movies opting for a simultaneous OTT release. The distinction between cinema and streaming premieres could blur. But we can also see this in a positive way, as at the time of COVID many films that were supposed to release in the theatres got releases on the different OTT platforms which was a boon for both the industry and the audience.\n",
      "It is also going to increase Global Connectivity. OTT platforms will bridge cultural gaps, allowing content from different regions to reach global audiences. This exchange of cultural perspectives will enrich the content landscape.\n",
      "Subscription-based models will remain prevalent, but hybrid models could emerge, combining subscriptions with pay-per-view options. Ad-supported free tiers might also coexist. The proliferation of OTT platforms will necessitate robust regulations to ensure content quality, data privacy, and fair competition.\n",
      "OTTs are also reshaping the Industry Landscape as the Traditional studios and networks are adapting or partnering with OTT platforms to stay relevant. As a result the industry’s landscape will continue to shift.\n",
      "As we journey toward 2040, the reign of OTT platforms in the entertainment arena is undeniable. They have revolutionized the way we consume content, placing choice, diversity, and convenience at the forefront. While challenges and transformations lie ahead, the fusion of technology, creativity, and global connectivity promises an era of entertainment that caters to the evolving preferences of audiences worldwide.\n",

      "“Entertainment is giving people what they want.” – Howard Hawks\n",
      "Entertainment, in its essence, is the art of captivating and delighting people, whisking them away from the mundane and into a world of imagination and emotion. It comes in various forms, from the tales told around ancient campfires to the dazzling spectacles of modern cinema. Traditionally, we relied on television, radio, and theatres to satiate our thirst for entertainment. However, a new dawn has emerged with the advent of Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms, which deliver a wide array of digital content directly to consumers over the internet, transforming the way we consume content. These platforms, accessible at the tap of a screen, are redefining the entertainment landscape, and their impact is both revolutionary and intriguing. As we project into the future, it is evident that the impact of OTT platforms on the entertainment industry will be profound by 2040. \n",
      "This essay explores the factors contributing to the rise of OTT platforms, their current significance, and the potential implications they may have on content creation, distribution, consumption, and the traditional media landscape.\n",
      "The Rise of OTT Platforms: A Historical Context\n",
      "The landscape of entertainment underwent a remarkable transformation with the rise of Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms, a shift that can be traced back to the early 2000s. This period marked the inception of a new era in content consumption, led by pioneering companies like Netflix, which dared to venture into uncharted territories of streaming content over the internet.\n",
      "In their initial stages, these OTT platforms focused on a rather modest goal – providing a digital reservoir of older movies and television shows. This innovative approach offered a departure from conventional entertainment delivery methods, introducing the concept of on-demand viewing. No longer were audiences tethered to rigid schedules dictated by traditional television broadcasts or cinema showtimes. Instead, viewers could now delve into a treasure trove of content at their convenience, ushering in a new era of viewer empowerment.\n",
      "The convenience of on-demand viewing was the first ripple in the pond, setting the stage for an even more profound transformation. As internet infrastructure and connectivity improved, a fertile ground was created for OTT platforms to flourish. With the steady march of technology, consumer preferences began to shift, demanding not only convenience but also diversity and originality in content offerings.\n",
      "Recognizing this demand, OTT platforms embarked on a journey to reinvent themselves. They swiftly evolved from being mere repositories of nostalgic classics to becoming creators and distributors of original programming. This strategic pivot marked a turning point, shaking the very foundations of traditional broadcast and cable TV models.\n",
      "Original programming injected fresh life into the realm of entertainment, captivating audiences with narratives that were previously unheard of. As OTT platforms unleashed their creative prowess, they embraced storytelling in all its diverse forms – from gripping dramas and thrilling mysteries to heartwarming comedies and eye-opening documentaries. This creative renaissance shattered the monopoly that traditional media had held for decades, offering a level playing field for both established and emerging storytellers.\n",
      "The expansion of OTT offerings wasn’t merely a quantitative growth; it represented a qualitative leap. Audiences were no longer limited to a predetermined menu of content; they were handed the reins to an expansive universe where choice and personalization reigned supreme. This revolution ignited a ripple effect across the entertainment industry, influencing content creators, and production studios, and even influencing the very way stories were conceived and told.\n",
      "Factors Driving the Rise of OTT Platforms\n",
      "\n",
      "Factors Driving the Rise of OTT Platforms\n",
      "1. Convenience and Personalization: OTT platforms offer unparalleled convenience and personalization. Viewers can access content whenever and wherever they want, catering to their schedules and preferences. The ability to create personalized profiles, curated recommendations, and watchlists has created a more tailored and engaging viewing experience.\n",
      "2. Content Variety and Original Programming: OTT platforms have invested heavily in producing high-quality original content, ranging from TV series and movies to documentaries and stand-up specials. This commitment to diverse and compelling content has attracted a broader audience and positioned OTT platforms as formidable competitors in the entertainment industry.\n",
      "3. Global Reach and Accessibility: The global accessibility of OTT platforms has broken down geographical barriers, enabling content creators to reach audiences worldwide without the limitations of traditional distribution channels. This has fostered cross-cultural exchange and enriched content diversity.\n",
      "4. Technological Advancements: Advancements in streaming technology, including improved video compression algorithms and faster internet speeds, have facilitated seamless content delivery. This has reduced buffering issues and enhanced the overall user experience, further incentivizing consumers to adopt OTT platforms.\n",
      "5. Disruption of Traditional Models: OTT platforms have disrupted traditional media models by offering subscription-based and ad-supported options that challenge the conventional pay-TV model. This disruption has prompted traditional media companies to adapt and create their streaming services, intensifying competition within the industry.\n",
      "The Current Significance of OTT Platforms\n",
      "As of the present day, OTT platforms have already significantly transformed the entertainment landscape. Major players like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu have amassed massive subscriber bases, challenging the dominance of cable and broadcast television. The ability of these platforms to produce critically acclaimed and culturally impactful original content, such as Stranger Things, The Mandalorian” and “The Crown” has further solidified their place in popular culture.\n",
      "OTT platforms have also revolutionized content consumption habits. Binge-watching, or consuming multiple episodes of a TV series in rapid succession, has become a cultural phenomenon enabled by the release of entire seasons at once. This shift in viewing behaviour has influenced storytelling techniques and narrative structures, as content creators aim to engage audiences over extended periods.\n",
      "Impact on Content Creation and Distribution\n",
      "Looking ahead to 2040, the impact of OTT platforms on content creation and distribution will likely be even more pronounced. The ability of these platforms to gather vast amounts of user data and insights will enable content creators to make more informed decisions about the type of content that resonates with audiences. This data-driven approach may lead to more targeted and innovative storytelling, resulting in a diverse range of content that caters to various tastes and preferences.\n",
      "Additionally, the direct-to-consumer model of OTT platforms eliminates the need for traditional distribution channels, reducing intermediaries and production costs. This may empower independent filmmakers and creators to showcase their work to a global audience, democratizing the content creation process and fostering creativity and diversity.\n",
      "However, the dominance of OTT platforms could also pose challenges to content diversity. While these platforms have expanded the range of stories being told, there is a risk that certain niche genres or perspectives may be overshadowed by the pursuit of mass appeal. Content algorithms that prioritize popular genres could limit exposure to lesser-known content, potentially hindering the discovery of unique voices.\n",
      "Changing Consumer Behavior and Expectations\n",
      "The rise of OTT platforms has fundamentally shifted consumer behaviour and expectations, and this trend is likely to continue. The demand for instant gratification, personalized recommendations, and a seamless viewing experience has set a high standard for the industry. By 2040, we can expect consumers to expect even more immersive and interactive experiences, driven by advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies.\n",
      "Furthermore, the concept of “cord-cutting” – the act of cancelling traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions in favour of OTT platforms – is projected to become the norm by 2040. As more households transition to streaming services, the traditional TV ecosystem could undergo a profound transformation, leading to changes in advertising models, revenue streams, and the overall content landscape.\n",
      "Diversified and Tailored Content Creation:\n",
      "By 2040, OTT platforms will have catalyzed a revolution in content creation. The democratization of production tools and distribution channels will empower a diverse range of creators to showcase their talents on a global stage. The boundaries of storytelling will be pushed, giving rise to narratives that reflect a spectrum of cultures, perspectives, and experiences. Personalization algorithms will refine content recommendations, ensuring that each individual’s entertainment journey is a unique and engaging one.\n",
      "The Erosion of Traditional Broadcast and Cable TV:\n",
      "The traditional broadcast and cable TV models, once the stalwarts of entertainment, will be shadows of their former selves. The dominance of OTT platforms will relegate scheduled programming to nostalgia, as audiences demand the freedom to curate their viewing schedules. Live streaming and real-time interaction will bridge the gap between virtual and reality, providing immersive experiences that redefine the concept of “appointment viewing.”\n",
      "Globalization of Content:\n",
      "The boundaries of geography will blur as OTT platforms transcend borders. By 2040, audiences around the world will effortlessly access content from diverse cultures, languages, and genres. The exchange of stories and ideas will foster cross-cultural understanding and appreciation, contributing to a more interconnected global society.\n",
      "Interactive and Immersive Experiences:\n",
      "The integration of emerging technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), will elevate entertainment to new heights. Viewers will step into the worlds of their favourite shows and movies, becoming active participants in the storytelling process. Immersive narratives and interactive elements will blur the line between fiction and reality, engaging audiences in ways never before imagined.\n",
      "Monetization and Industry Dynamics:\n",
      "The monetization landscape will undergo a profound transformation. Advertising models will evolve as targeted, non-intrusive ads replace traditional commercial breaks. Subscription-based and pay-per-view models will flourish, providing viewers with a plethora of options tailored to their preferences. The traditional “box office” concept will extend beyond theatres, as online premieres and exclusive releases become the norm.\n",
      "Challenges and Considerations\n",
      "While the rise of OTT platforms presents numerous opportunities, it also raises important considerations and challenges for the entertainment industry. The proliferation of streaming services could lead to subscription fatigue, where consumers are overwhelmed by the sheer number of available platforms. This may drive some users to piracy or result in a decline in overall revenue for the industry.\n",
      "Additionally, issues related to data privacy and content moderation will continue to be significant concerns. The collection of user data to improve recommendations and advertising targeting raises questions about the ethical use of personal information. Furthermore, the open nature of online platforms can make it difficult to regulate inappropriate or harmful content, requiring industry stakeholders and policymakers to collaborate on effective solutions.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "In conclusion, the rise of OTT platforms has already made a substantial impact on the entertainment industry, and their influence is likely to be even more profound by 2040. The convenience, personalization, and global accessibility of these platforms have transformed content consumption habits and disrupted traditional media models. As we project into the future, we can anticipate further advancements in technology, changes in content creation and distribution, and evolving consumer behaviour and expectations.\n",
      "While the challenges posed by the rise of OTT platforms should not be overlooked, their potential to democratize content creation, offer diverse narratives, and provide innovative viewing experiences is undeniable. Industry stakeholders, content creators, and policymakers must collaborate to navigate these challenges and harness the full potential of OTT platforms for the benefit of both creators and consumers in the evolving entertainment landscape of 2040.\n",

      "Title of the URL :  Rise of Cyber Crime and its Effects\n",
      "Text of the URL :  \n",
      "Cybercrime is the most discussed problem in the twenty-first century. The usage of cell phones and the internet is increasing dramatically over the world, which is generating questions about consumers’ security and privacy. Because of this, all users must understand cybercrime and security. Cybercrime is defined as organised criminal conduct carried out by attackers online. Cybercrime comes in numerous forms, such as fraud, computer viruses, cyberstalking, and others. Due to these, businesses and government organisations are spending more on maintaining and employing professionals in cybercrime.\n",
      "7 Cyber security keywords: –\n",
      "1- Artificial Intelligence\n",
      "AI has been around for quite a while now and one of its most memorable advancements was the Go game between ‘AlphaGo’, a computer Go program developed by Google DeepMind, and the world champion Lee Se-dol. AlphaGo was able to use its collected data to achieve its goal. The so-called ‘weak AI’ used on AlphaGo is also applied to various fields within cyber security.\n",
      "2. Ransomware\n",
      "Over the past years, ransomware has been aiming at innumerable targets. However, its new method of attack now aims at specific targets, where companies, communities, and public institutions are at risk. Companies with strong financial powers are most likely to be their targets as the attackers will be rewarded huge sums of money for their success. Those providing Infra and Database storage, local government and healthcare organizations, are listed as the main targets of ransomware attacks.\n",
      "3. Supply Chain Attack\n",
      "A supply chain attack is a cyber-attack that affects the organization by targeting less-secure elements in the supply network. Supply Chain attacks were already on the list of the 7 Cybersecurity keywords last year, and still manage to maintain their place. Such attacks will continue to infiltrate the supply chain through third-party systems and services. Therefore, due to its weak security systems, those purchasing third-party vendor products and services must take extra caution.\n",
      "4. Cloud\n",
      "The interest in Cloud Security is on the rise. However, it is pointed out that Cloud computing’s largest vulnerability is the operator’s configuration error. More complex and flexible Cloud systems will eventually lead to a greater number of errors and reveal itself as a target for many cyber attackers.\n",
      "5. Malicious emails\n",
      "Receiving emails containing malware is not a new thing anymore. The Financial Security Institute warns us how malware email attacks are becoming more cunning and harder to block. Spear Phishing, a traditional method of attack that uses HWP and DOC documents, will not stop this year.\n",
      "6. Internet of Things (IoT)\n",
      "Building castles in the air was the perfect phrase to describe how IoT was perceived. However, IoT has now become a part of our lives. People can now watch YouTube on their refrigerators and gas valves can be closed by using Smartphone applications. Many are experiencing an easier lifestyle but are also suffering from many cyber threats.\n",
      "7. Darkweb\n",
      "Due to several incidents, Darkweb, which was only known to cyber attackers and security professionals, is now well-known to the public. For example, Warez and Webhard are the two programs in which Netizens in Korea can improve their networking skills but also leads them to be involved in distributing illegal programs and even in cybercrime.\n",
      "There are millions and billions of users and websites in the vast community known as cyberspace. People utilise it for a variety of activities including e-commerce, transactions, shopping, movies, music, and video games. Anyone can simply access anything online in the current technological era owing to an accessible internet connection. As a result, crime in general and cybercrime, in particular, have surged dramatically. Additionally, the faster internet connection has greatly boosted the rate of data circulation. All of these problems are responsible for why cyber security has grown to be a significant issue for society.\n",
      "The government has created several cybercrime-related laws to curb the spread of crime and to protect people’s interests. These laws also provide a defence against cybercrime. Aside from that, the government has established cyber cells in police stations to combat cybercrime as quickly as possible.\n",
      "Cybercrime is an attack that can be harmful to both an individual and a business. There have been several instances where a Cyber Attack led to a data leak that caused a significant loss for a business or a person. These cyber-attacks could have negative effects on the country and the business. The countless instances of cyberattacks that have taken place in India and other nations have necessitated increased security measures. There are four main categories of cybercrime, according to a popular definition—hacking, money, privacy, and cyber-terrorism.\n",
      "Cybercrime is a type of crime in which illegal activities are carried out online or using computers. Cybercrime comes in a variety of forms which involves harassing online users. Cybercrime is the most serious and rapidly expanding type of crime in this day and age. Any person’s life may be negatively impacted for a very long time by becoming a cyber victim. Cybercrimes have a wide range of repercussions on financial and investment activity in digital organisations.\n",
      "One typical tactic used by criminals is to lure online users in by creating attractive websites and sending phoney emails purporting to be from banks or other organisations and asking for personal information. It makes it easier for criminals to access a person’s bank account and personal data. Due to viruses, mail fraud, account hacking, and software piracy, people have been victims of cybercrimes. They also run into problems with unauthorised access mailing, threats from pornographic emails, and video transmission.\n",
      "Types of Cyber Crime\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyberstalking | It is the use of electronic communication to track down a person or to make repeated attempts to get in touch with them to foster personal interaction despite their blatant lack of interest. Anyone who monitors the internet, email, or any other form of electronic communication is guilty of stalking.\n",
      "Phishing | It is a sort of fraud that includes collecting personal data from recipients of emails that seem to be coming from a reliable source, including Customer ID, IPIN, Credit/Debit Card number, Card expiration date, CVV number, etc.\n",
      "Vishing | It is an attempt when criminals attempt to obtain personal information over the phone, such as Customer ID, Net Banking password, ATM PIN, OTP, Card expiration date, CVV, etc.\n",
      "Smishing | It is a sort of fraud that employs text messages sent to mobile devices to entice victims into dialling a fake phone number, going to a fake website, or downloading harmful software.\n",
      "Impersonation And Identity Theft | This includes the dishonest or fraudulent use of another person’s electronic signature, password, or other distinctive identification trait.\n",
      "Virus, Worms, Trojan | A computer virus is a program designed to infiltrate your computer, corrupt your files and data, and spread itself. Worms are malicious software applications that repeatedly duplicate themselves on local drives, network shares, etc. A Trojan is a malicious program that mimics a legitimate application. Trojans offer unauthorised people and applications access to your computer through a backdoor entry, allowing them to steal sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to Prevent Cyber Crime\n",
      "\n",
      "Back up every piece of information—data, systems, and considerations—to make it easier for businesses to recover from unforeseen events with the help of prior data.\n",
      "Pick a firewall that offers protection from viruses, malware, and dishonest hackers.\n",
      "Never divulge private information to a stranger since they might exploit it for fraud.\n",
      "To avoid cybercrime, check your security settings—to determine if someone has logged into your computer, a cyber firewall analyses your network settings.\n",
      "Antivirus software aids in identifying potential threats and malware before they infect a computer system. Never use software that has been cracked since it poses a serious risk of data loss or malware attack.\n",
      "Keep your information protected when accessing untrusted websites—information can readily bypass the data through phishing websites.\n",

      "How machine learning will affect your business?\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "Machine learning techniques may have been used for years, but recently there has been an explosion in their applications. In fact, in a recent Q3 earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said “Machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we’re re-thinking how we’re doing everything.” And they’re far from the only business making that claim.\n",
      "In the past, successful use of machine learning algorithms required bespoke algorithms and huge R&D budgets, but all that is changing. IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure, Amazon, and Alibaba all launched turnkey cloud-based machine-learning SaaS solutions in 2015. At the same time startups like Idibon, MetaMind, Dato, and MonkeyLearn have built machine learning products that companies can take advantage of.\n",
      "Gartner already puts machine learning at the top of its hype curve, and no: machine learning won’t replace all of your employees with computers or suddenly double your revenue. But that doesn’t mean that it can’t give every business a competitive advantage. There are plenty of business processes that can significantly benefit from machine learning. So how does machine learning change the way businesses operate?\n",
      "First thing’s first: Machine learning needs training data and training data costs money. Especially training data labeled by humans. Let me explain. To make machine learning work for business, the algorithm needs to see lots and lots of examples of what it’s supposed to be doing. If you want an algorithm to tell you if a sales lead is good, you need to show it lots and lots of examples of good sales leads and bad sales leads. If you want an algorithm to tag the support tickets you need to show it many examples of support tickets. If you localize your algorithm to a new language you probably need to collect lots of examples in that language. In some instances, a company may have those training sets in-house. For example, a bunch of disqualified or qualified leads. But say you haven’t labeled each of your support tickets as they’ve come in over the year. You’d need to have people either in-house or en masse via a data enrichment platform -label those tickets. The machine will then look at those judgments and start finding connections and patterns it can learn from.\n",
      "Machine learning is much cheaper and more efficient than people when it works well. The downside is that it often works well in 80 percent of the cases and badly in 20 percent of the cases, and lowering the 20 percent error rate is hard, if not impossible. But even an 80 percent accurate algorithm can save you a lot of money because good machine learning algorithms know where they are accurate and where they are more likely to have errors. Smart companies take the cases where the algorithm has high confidence and uses those directly while sending low confidence cases to humans. Banks have been doing this for years. When you put a check in an ATM, an algorithm tries to decipher the numbers on the check. If you have really sloppy handwriting or the ink is smudged the algorithm passes the task to a human. This design pattern saves banks lots of money while preserving a very high level of accuracy.\n",
      "A huge benefit of machine learning is that it can turn part of your variable cost into more of a fixed cost. If you use humans to handle cases where that algorithm is struggling, you are creating the perfect training data to feed into your algorithm. This is a well-studied technique called active learning it turns out that training data labels collected on cases where the algorithm has low confidence help the algorithm learn much, much more efficiently.\n",
      "As the algorithm becomes increasingly more accurate, the unit economics of your business process become better and as machine learning becomes able to handle more cases, the expensive humans are only called in on the toughest, rarest situations. That means you use the best of both human and machine intelligence in tandem: leveraging the speed and reliability of computers for the easy judgments and the fluency and expertise of humans for the difficult ones. And if that sounds like smart business, it’s because it is.\n"

      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "Throughout history, from the industrial revolution in the 18th century through the development of the Internet, technology has been the primary driver of societal change. It has aided in turning cities into smart urban centers that provide more opportunities and improvements in quality of life. It continues to play a crucial role in altering the world. Cities are acting as engines of economic growth and modernization as they become more technologically advanced, considerably accelerating the trajectory of global development. Technology has had nothing short of revolutionary effects on Indian cities, ushering in a new era of change and advancement. India’s metropolitan centers have embraced technology in ways that are transforming the fundamental fabric of urban life, from infrastructure to governance and beyond, as the world rushes into the digital age.\n",
      "India’s cities must play a crucial part if the nation is to develop into a worldwide economic powerhouse. One of the world’s economies with the greatest growth rates, India aims to reach US$5 trillion in GDP by 2026 and US$40 trillion by 2047, the year it will celebrate 100 years of independence. The idea of smart cities is one of technology’s most obvious effects. Indian cities are progressively implementing cutting-edge technologies to build effective, linked urban landscapes. To improve the quality of life for people, smart cities use data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation. Smart traffic management solutions, for instance, improve traffic flow while lowering congestion and air pollution. Sensor-based garbage collection improves waste management, resulting in cleaner and healthier settings.\n",
      "To become a major player in the world economy, however, several steps are being followed. A crucial one relates to India’s ongoing urbanization development. Between 1970 and 2018, the population of Indian cities is predicted to have expanded from 109 million to 460 million, nearly a fourfold increase.\n",
      "Cities foster increased productivity through several routes, generally known as agglomeration economies, by permitting close contact between businesses and employees. The theory’s main consequence is that businesses in bigger and/or denser cities should be more productive. In the year 2035, urbanization has had a significant impact on both India and the rest of the world. India now boasts the third-largest economy in the world, only behind China and the United States. In this new period, China has already exceeded the USA in terms of economic size, while India has surpassed Japan to claim a higher place. Although India has 675 million people living in urbanized cities, China has a stunning one billion people living in urbanized cities.\n",
      "Urbanization has both advantages and disadvantages, including financial expenditures. Although city growth can result in better possibilities and a higher standard of living, it also presents difficulties and issues. Rapid urbanization has the potential to deplete resources, harm the environment, and worsen socioeconomic inequities. Depending on how well these problems are solved, urbanization will either have a favorable or negative overall effect.\n",
      "With more than half of the world’s population now living in cities, urbanization has emerged as a major force for development. But it also presents fresh difficulties and chances, reshaping the planet and our way of life in unexpected ways. A future where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly pervasive and has an impact on many parts of our daily lives has been ushered in by this shift. Urbanization has improved living conditions and economic opportunities, but it also calls for careful management and sustainable practices to guarantee a bright and prosperous future for everybody.\n",
      "Similarly, to this, a nation’s population and demography can contribute significantly to its growth. India’s rapidly rising working-age population will be in its favor, and the nation is expected to host some of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the years to come. The West is also taken aback by the annual GDP growth rate of the cities that are predicted to top the charts. Aside from a few towns in Southeast Asia, all of the cities are now from the Asian bloc, which is primarily controlled by India and China. Bangalore, which has had an enormous 8.5 percent GDP growth, is in first place, followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore’s startup culture and enormous skill pool set it apart from other cities. Bangalore itself is probably going to be the future Silicon Valley of Asia and the entire world. It currently creates a tremendous number of startups. It has the potential to rank among the world’s most urbanized cities. These cities will outpace the global average yearly GDP growth rate, which is expected to be about 2.5%, by a sizeable margin.\n",
      "Undoubtedly, nations will expand and cities will modernize to meet societal demands. Urban city growth has mostly been attributed to rural-to-urban migration. However, the future will be better for us and our offspring if we can maintain a balance between the environment and sustainable growth. We are being impacted by climate change, which is real. In large areas, the effects of climate change will harm the environment through prolonged heat waves, more irregular rainfall, drought, and flooding.\n",
      "As we can see in Pakistan, China, and Europe. Europe as a whole has seen heat waves that have disrupted society, and China is currently dealing with extreme heat waves that are drying up the rivers and making it impossible to produce hydroelectricity. In Pakistan, there were an unusually high number of floods. Out of 160 districts, 110 are underwater, representing a loss of roughly $10 billion.  Rural agrarian and pastoralist types of society, which heavily rely on the environment, are severely impacted by these effects. Climate-driven migration is projected to rise as livelihoods all around the world are affected more and more by climate change.\n",
      "The broader prospects of regional environments are likewise impacted by urbanization. Large increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the frequency of days with thunderstorms are also observed in areas that are downwind from large industrial complexes. Urban regions produce more precipitation, but they also have less water filtration, which lowers the water tables. Urban areas consume significantly more energy than rural communities do for heating, cooking, transportation, and electricity. For instance, today’s metropolitan populations have more cars than rural ones.\n",
      "Due to technology, both healthcare and education are going through significant changes. By extending access to high-quality education outside the walls of traditional classrooms, online education platforms are democratizing learning. Remote places are now being reached by telemedicine, which allows doctors to diagnose and treat patients at a distance and close healthcare gaps. These advancements are essential in a large, varied nation like India where achieving fair access to healthcare and education has historically proven difficult.\n",
      "The effect of technology on job trends is another factor to take into account. Technology opens up new possibilities, but it also challenges established employment positions, raising concerns about job displacement and the need for skill upgrading. To ensure that no one is left behind in the wake of these changes, it is essential to strike a balance between technological advancement and social welfare.\n",
      "Technology also stimulates economic development and entrepreneurship. A wider audience can now be reached by small enterprises thanks to the growth of digital platforms, promoting economic inclusion. The gig economy is altering established labor patterns and creating new employment opportunities as a result of technology-driven platforms. In tech centers like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune, startups are thriving and fostering innovation in a variety of industries.\n",

      "By 2040, OTT platforms will have catalyzed a revolution in content creation. The democratization of production tools and distribution channels will empower a diverse range of creators to showcase their talents on a global stage. The boundaries of storytelling will be pushed, giving rise to narratives that reflect a spectrum of cultures, perspectives, and experiences. Personalization algorithms will refine content recommendations, ensuring that each individual’s entertainment journey is a unique and engaging one.\n",
      "The Erosion of Traditional Broadcast and Cable TV:\n",
      "The traditional broadcast and cable TV models, once the stalwarts of entertainment, will be shadows of their former selves. The dominance of OTT platforms will relegate scheduled programming to nostalgia, as audiences demand the freedom to curate their viewing schedules. Live streaming and real-time interaction will bridge the gap between virtual and reality, providing immersive experiences that redefine the concept of “appointment viewing.”\n",
      "Globalization of Content:\n",
      "The boundaries of geography will blur as OTT platforms transcend borders. By 2040, audiences around the world will effortlessly access content from diverse cultures, languages, and genres. The exchange of stories and ideas will foster cross-cultural understanding and appreciation, contributing to a more interconnected global society.\n",
      "Interactive and Immersive Experiences:\n",
      "The integration of emerging technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), will elevate entertainment to new heights. Viewers will step into the worlds of their favourite shows and movies, becoming active participants in the storytelling process. Immersive narratives and interactive elements will blur the line between fiction and reality, engaging audiences in ways never before imagined.\n",
      "Monetization and Industry Dynamics:\n",
      "The monetization landscape will undergo a profound transformation. Advertising models will evolve as targeted, non-intrusive ads replace traditional commercial breaks. Subscription-based and pay-per-view models will flourish, providing viewers with a plethora of options tailored to their preferences. The traditional “box office” concept will extend beyond theatres, as online premieres and exclusive releases become the norm.\n",
      "Challenges and Considerations\n",
      "While the rise of OTT platforms presents numerous opportunities, it also raises important considerations and challenges for the entertainment industry. The proliferation of streaming services could lead to subscription fatigue, where consumers are overwhelmed by the sheer number of available platforms. This may drive some users to piracy or result in a decline in overall revenue for the industry.\n",
      "Additionally, issues related to data privacy and content moderation will continue to be significant concerns. The collection of user data to improve recommendations and advertising targeting raises questions about the ethical use of personal information. Furthermore, the open nature of online platforms can make it difficult to regulate inappropriate or harmful content, requiring industry stakeholders and policymakers to collaborate on effective solutions.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "In conclusion, the rise of OTT platforms has already made a substantial impact on the entertainment industry, and their influence is likely to be even more profound by 2040. The convenience, personalization, and global accessibility of these platforms have transformed content consumption habits and disrupted traditional media models.

      "One of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high-speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past, the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor, making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However, with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools, telemedicine consultations are just as good as in-person visits.\n",
      "Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine, patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead, they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas, where access to healthcare can be limited.\n",
      "Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer, the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time.\n",
      "Another substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors, telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example, a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient’s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment.\n",
      "Telemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes, telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition, telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization.\n",
      "One of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes, telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition, telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need.\n",
      "Another way in which telemedicine will impact people’s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely, telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors’ spending on administrative tasks, freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care.\n",
      "One major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology, it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing, remote monitoring, and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it.\n",
      "Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. Patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas; patients may travel long distances to access medical care. Telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances, saving them time and money.\n",
      "Finally, telemedicine’s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. As more and more people work from home or other remote locations, the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing. Telemedicine allows employees to consult with healthcare providers from their homes, reducing the need for them to take time off work to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider.\n",
      "Overall, the rise of telemedicine by 2040 is a result of a combination of factors, including the increasing use of technology in healthcare, the need for improved access to healthcare, and the growing trend of remote work. As these factors continue to evolve, likely, telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of the healthcare landscape.\n",
      "However, the rise of telemedicine is also likely to present some challenges. For example, telemedicine consultations may only be suitable for some medical conditions, and some patients may still need to see a doctor. Additionally, telemedicine may put some jobs at risk, such as receptionists and other administrative staff in healthcare facilities.\n",

      "Rise of e-health and its impact on humans by the year 2030\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "The rise of e-health, or the use of electronic means to facilitate health care, has been a major development in the healthcare industry in recent years. The use of technology to improve access to healthcare and make it more efficient has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about healthcare and its delivery. By 2030, it is likely that e-health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare, and this essay will explore the potential impacts of e-health on humans by that year.\n",
      "One of the main benefits of e-health is the increased access it provides to healthcare services. With the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies, patients can receive care from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for those who live in rural or underserved areas, where access to healthcare providers may be limited. It can also be useful for those with mobility issues or disabilities that make it difficult for them to visit a healthcare facility in person. By 2030, it is likely that the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies will become even more widespread, potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare disparities and an increase in access to care for those who may have previously had difficulty accessing it.\n",
      "In addition to increasing access to care, e-health has the potential to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. By using electronic medical records and other digital technologies, healthcare providers can more easily share and access patient information, streamlining the process of providing care.

By 2030, it is likely that the use of electronic medical records and other digital technologies will become even more widespread, potentially leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system.\n",
      "Another potential impact of e-health by 2030 is the ability to use data analytics to improve population health. By collecting and analyzing data on patient health and healthcare utilization, healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns that may help them better understand and address the health needs of their patient populations. This could lead to the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies that are more effective at improving population health. Additionally, the use of wearable technology and other digital health devices can help individuals track and manage their own health, potentially leading to improved health outcomes for individuals and populations.\n",
      "While the potential benefits of e-health are significant, there are also potential challenges and drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for cybersecurity breaches, which could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. It is important for healthcare organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect patient data. Another concern is the potential for the use of e-health to exacerbate healthcare disparities, as those who are unable to afford or access the necessary technology may be left behind. Ensuring that e-health technologies are accessible and affordable to all is an important consideration as the use of e-health continues to grow.\n",
      "In conclusion, by 2030 it is likely that e-health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare. The increased access to care and improved efficiency provided by e-health technologies have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry and improve health outcomes for individuals and populations. However, it is important to consider and address potential challenges and drawbacks, such as cybersecurity concerns and healthcare disparities, as the use of e-health continues to grow.\n",

      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "2020 was the year the world was ravaged by the SarsCov2 virus. This notorious virus brought about a pandemic that would go on to change the course of humanity.  From that point forth daily lives of everyone across the world changed. With widespread stringent lockdowns, the entire world came to a sharp halt. Not only was the general populace affected, but the pandemic also affected all industries. The pandemic did not even spare critical industries, like healthcare and security. While these industries were required to function for the benefit of society, their daily operations changed drastically. But just as human nature prevails, we rose from this adversity. Post pandemic era saw the rise of new technologies that could aid overcome the restrictions put forth by the pandemic. In this article, we will specifically focus on the healthcare industries, innovations done in the industry, and the impact of those innovations on humans by 2030.\n",
      "Lockdowns initiated to curb the pandemic caused people to stay in their homes at all times. The exception to this was the medical staff who acted as our first line of defense against the pandemic. They not only had to deal with the pandemic but also had to cater to patients suffering from various other ailments. While people were restricted to go out, they still required medical consultation for their issues. This conundrum led to the rise of imparting healthcare facilities over electronic media. Healthcare workers utilized technologies such as video calls and virtual meetings to reach out to the needy. Now, these practices are also known as ‘e-Health’.  As the pandemic raged on, society saw numerous initiatives in the e-health sector. Government-led initiatives like ‘eSanjeevani OPD’ brought government OPD facilities directly to people’s homes.  It should be noted that e-health is not just limited to providing patients with virtual meetings. It encompasses every technology that transitions the traditional healthcare sector into a more accessible electronic form. Keeping with this trend we also saw the use of the Internet of Things (IoT)  to build the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). These internet-connected devices allowed remote monitoring and controlling of facilities imparted to patients.  With the onset of 5G technology, the use of  IoMT has flourished. Some of these solutions include smart devices that monitor an individual’s health metrics. These devices are also capable of sending out alerts in case the metrics do not fall under the acceptable range. Furthermore with the advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning technologies these devices do more than just report. With the help of these technologies, IoMT devices are now capable of intelligently performing actions that keep the metric of a patient in check.\n",
      "Another interesting technology that has found its use in the healthcare industry is ‘Blockchain technology. The technology used as the base for cryptocurrency can also be used to maintain immutable records of patients. Such blockchain solutions are already finding their way into the market Pranacare, is one such India start-up. It is a  platform for doctors driven by blockchain and AI. It offers tools to help dieticians, diabetologists, and cardiac specialists manage their customers and data. It also maintains, tracks, and records patient data and offers a decentralized ledger. The armchair is another organization that combines blockchain technology and the health industry.  The armchair provides an Ethereum-based platform for electronic health records storage. The blockchain is a hybrid public/private network that analyses data using Artificial Intelligence. Will use Ethereum Smart Contracts with the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform to offer a safe method for both patients and providers to access patient data. Existing e-health services also saw a rise during the pandemic. For example, telemedicine visits increased from 1-2% of ambulatory care visits before to the pandemic to 30% of all visits. With customer readiness to adopt telehealth climbing to 66%. According to health systems, up to 40% of primary care appointments might be performed remotely.\n",
      "With the increased penetration of the internet in our daily lives, it has been now critical for companies and start-ups to capture this segment. Keeping in with this agenda, the market has seen a proliferation of companies providing e-health services. Consequently, this industry has also seen an increase.in investments. Between 2019 and 2020, investments in telemedicine solutions quadrupled, rising from $1.1 billion to $3.1 billion. In 2020, total funding for remote patient monitoring (RPM) solutions will have more than quadrupled, rising from $417 million to $941 million. According to e-healthcare investors, RPM solutions for chronic care management are expected to become more popular in the next coming years. Analysts predict that eHealth will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 16.1% from 2022 to 2030, with the eHealth segment expected to generate $61.4 billion in sales in 2023 alone. China is expected to lead the global market followed by the USA. Overall, the e-Health industry is expected to see a boom in investments, providing early investors with a large return for their investments.\n",
      "While e-Health seems like the probable future for the entire healthcare industry, special attention must be given to the security aspect of these services. Being connected to the internet and being made available to all also attracts a lot of nefarious elements. Cybercriminals continually target the healthcare industry. The ransomware attack on AIIMS New Delhi is a prime example of this. Cybercriminals were able to cripple AIIMS systems. For over two weeks this caused massive chaos and confusion among the general public. The pandemic itself saw a large number of healthcare-themed smishing and vishing attacks. Their major motive was to exploit the insecure and scared public and make use of the pandemic to extort money. Every example of a cyberattack on a healthcare industry has always led to massive chaos. Healthcare is considered a critical industry, thereby it needs to be adequately protected. With e-Health on the rise, by 2023 society can also expect a lot of jobs to open in the sector of cyber security in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "e-Health solutions are the need of the hour. Integrating e-Health solutions with up-and-coming technologies can effectively ensure inclusivity for all. Such solutions can bring healthcare facilities to the remotest parts of the earth. With current trends in sight, 2030 is expected to have a large market share occupied by e-Health solutions. Early investors can expect high returns by 2030. With this in mind, special focus should also be given to securing the ever-growing e-health industry.\n",

      "“More gains on quality, affordability and accessibility are on the way”\n",
      "What do tele-med means?\n",
      "As the world evolves and advances, so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It’s not an overnight change, but more like how summer turns into fall – gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040? I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all, what is telemedicine? It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another.\n",
      "Role of tele-med during a pandemic\n",
      "Telemedicine’s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone, capable of video interactions, can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals, for example, Intermountain’s’s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in-person clinics and offices, psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in-person visits.\n",
      "Advantages of Telemed in today’s era\n",
      "Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two-pronged nightmare. There’s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next, wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance, telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan.\n",
      "Rise of the telemedicine industry post-pandemic\n",
      "Source: The Indian Express\n",
      "This step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, and 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability.\n",
      "Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs, but—as expected—this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall, consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties (Exhibit 2).\n",
      "Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward—up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID-19.\n",
      "Its impact on human beings over the years\n",
      "Moreover, our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions, such as a “digital front door” or lower-cost virtual-first health plan.6 However, a gap has historically existed between consumers’ expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface, breaking down silos in care provision (across virtual and in-person) with improved data integration and insights, and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes.\n",
      "Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health, improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends, those with chronic and mental health issues, and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights:\n",
      "“ Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic. Similarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-COVID-19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed, fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating.”\n",
      "Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead, substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic.\n",
      "Is the rise in tele-med industry temporary or will keep growing?\n",
      "The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas, such as urgent care and specialty care, patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward, there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike.\n",
      "Role of business leaders in achieving new model\n",
      "When creating a new model of health care, the hard work is in the details, and because a tele-driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery, developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design, shape, and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but here are two major considerations: reimbursement and care delivery requisites.\n",
      "Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid-19 struck, sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals, experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5% annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical-cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now.\n",
      "Summing it up\n",
      "Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well, the transition to a tele-driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance, it could take decades—if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.\n",

      "Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "“More gains on quality, affordability and accessibility are on the way”\n",
      "What do tele-med means?\n",
      "As the world evolves and advances, so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It’s not an overnight change, but more like how summer turns into fall – gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040? I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all, what is telemedicine? It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another.\n",
      "Role of tele-med during a pandemic\n",
      "Telemedicine’s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone, capable of video interactions, can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals, for example, Intermountain’s’s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in-person clinics and offices, psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in-person visits.\n",
      "Advantages of Telemed in today’s era\n",
      "Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two-pronged nightmare. There’s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next, wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance, telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan.\n",
      "Rise of the telemedicine industry post-pandemic\n",
      "Source: The Indian Express\n",
      "This step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, and 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability.\n",
      "Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs, but—as expected—this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall, consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties (Exhibit 2).\n",
      "Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward—up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID-19.\n",
      "Its impact on human beings over the years\n",
      "Moreover, our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions, such as a “digital front door” or lower-cost virtual-first health plan.6 However, a gap has historically existed between consumers’ expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface, breaking down silos in care provision (across virtual and in-person) with improved data integration and insights, and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes.\n",
      "Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health, improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends, those with chronic and mental health issues, and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights:\n",
      "“ Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic. Similarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-COVID-19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed, fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating.”\n",
      "Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead, substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic.\n",
      "Is the rise in tele-med industry temporary or will keep growing?\n",
      "The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas, such as urgent care and specialty care, patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward, there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike.\n",
      "Role of business leaders in achieving new model\n",
      "When creating a new model of health care, the hard work is in the details, and because a tele-driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery, developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design, shape, and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but here are two major considerations: reimbursement and care delivery requisites.\n",
      "Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid-19 struck, sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals, experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5% annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical-cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now.\n",
      "Summing it up\n",
      "Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well, the transition to a tele-driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance, it could take decades—if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.\n",

      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "The human race is known to come up with inventions that decide its future. Many scholars believe that Artificial Intelligence(AI) has been the most pioneering innovation since early humans discovered fire and invented the wheel. The advancement of groundbreaking technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) have constantly been shaping the future of humankind. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg have welcomed the evolution of AI. He once stated- “With A.I. especially, I am optimistic“. While according to Elon Musk, “AI can outsmart and endanger us.” However, we simply cannot ignore how useful and influential AI is in our daily lives.\n",
      "The applications of AI and ML have delved deeply into various domains. The least to mention are Healthcare, Transportation, Education, Media, Communication, Manufacturing, and Customer service. Businesses worldwide are placing a significant emphasis on enhancing their customers’ overall experiences. As a result of AI, a massive leap in customer experience service has come up with the evolution of chatbots.\n",
      "Chatbots are AI-based systems used by businesses for communication with customers. Customers can interact with chatbots directly via chat and voice applications. Numerous online customer service platforms are utilizing chatbots to manage bulk phone calls, FAQs, and other common customer service inquiries. Chatbots resolve customer queries within no time and are accessible 24X7, enhancing the customer experience.\n",
      "The use of technologies such as AI, ML, and NLP (Natural Language Processing), enables the bot to analyze and identify the user’s problems and instantly give the most relevant answers to the queries.\n",
      "Platforms such as Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Discord, and Slack have been extensively using chatbots for better communication.\n",
      "There are numerous advantages of using chatbots in businesses- Chatbots can communicate with multiple customers at once. They can be used to send regular updates about the products and exclusive offers by the company. They are available throughout the day, which is crucial for businesses that expand globally in different time zones. It becomes too cumbersome for businesses to have customer care support centers at various locations across the world. There is no human intervention involved. Therefore, chatbots can be accessed worldwide anytime. Chatbots reply instantly, and hence it increases customer engagement. Chatbots can also be extensively used to collect user data and analyze it further to provide customized solutions. ML-based chatbot systems are learning from past conversations to generate more thoughtful replies.\n",
      "Roughly 40 % of internet users around the globe prefer interacting with chatbots rather than virtual agents. With leading sectors such as retail and healthcare rapidly turning towards digital technology, chatbots will continue to grow in popularity in the years to come.\n",
      "According to some reports, it is anticipated that the size of the global chatbot market will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 26% from the years 2022 to 2030. In the year 2021, the chatbot market size was valued at a total of USD 525 million.\n",
      "It is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market.\n",
      "In the past few years, some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology, the tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, respectively.\n",
      "Deep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on Wall Street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. It has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. Chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue, conducting research, generating leads, and increasing brand awareness. Other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation.\n",
      "Given the trends of the data, we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion-dollar mark in a few years. Hence, by 2040 the chatbot industry would be having a multi-billion dollar market value.\n",
      "Bank of America is responsible for creating one of the most groundbreaking innovations. The recently introduced “Erica” is intended to assist customers in making more informed choices regarding their finances. Customers can make payments, check their balances, save money, and transfer funds with this chatbot, which uses artificial intelligence, algorithms, and predictive messaging. Erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice, and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer.\n",
      "KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. KLM increased the number of customer interactions with the Facebook messenger app by forty percent. The airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers’ right to personal privacy. KLM was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using Facebook and Messenger, so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. Messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details, boarding passes, and flight status updates. On a typical day, KLM receives an average of five messages per minute through Facebook Messenger. During peak traffic, that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute.\n",
      "These innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040, chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain.\n",
      "There are apparent constraints with AI technology. The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI-driven chatbots are used with customers, even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers.\n",
      "The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer’s data is also a key challenge.\n",
      "Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function, there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi-folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML-based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps “The next big thing” in the customer service domain.\n",

      "Rise of e-health and its impact on humans by the year 2030\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The phrase “e-health” refers to “Internet medicine” as well as almost everything else connected to computers and healthcare. It appears that industry leaders and marketing professionals, not academics, were the first to adopt the word. To bring the promises, principles, and excitement (and hype) surrounding e-commerce (electronic commerce) to the health arena and to give an account of the new possibilities the Internet is opening up for the area of health care, they created and used this term in line with other “e-words” such as e-commerce, e-business, e-solutions, and so on.\n",
      "E-health emerged in the modern world as a result of the demand for better patient tracking of their healthcare and operations, notably for purposes of reimbursement from organizations like insurance companies. In the past, healthcare professionals kept paper records of the patient’s history and current condition. However, the development of an electronic tracking system was pushed by rising healthcare expenses and technological advancements. The field of telemedicine, in which a telecommunications medium is utilized to deliver medical care remotely, evolved as e-health technology advanced.\n",
      "Growth of E-health\n",
      "The e-health industry saw tremendous expansion following the epidemic, with several new companies being created as “buddies” for e-health treatment. such as the market leaders in a positive way right now, Oura Health, Vantage Health, Mendelian, and HealthifyMe. They target those who are looking for economical healthcare facilities by offering E-health at lower prices. Accessibility from the East is another aspect of e-health care brands. Some benefits of e-health care facilities include quality, improved doctor-patient relationships, a wider audience, better communication, tracking of health, and convenience of follow-ups.\n",
      "Impact of technology on E-health\n",
      "The recently introduced 5G services will present an ocean of chances for e-health services, according to a study by “EY.” In addition to accelerating the deployment of telemedicine, 5G may improve the interaction between health sensors, algorithms, and smart gadgets.\n",
      "In 2021, the size of the global e-health market was estimated at USD 97,640.4 million. By 2030, it is anticipated to reach USD 338,147.7 million, expanding at a CAGR of 14.8% over the forecast period (2022-2030). As we can see, the fast-expanding e-health sector is changing how healthcare is provided. This caused a large portion of the population to switch from conventional healthcare practices to electronic health. Now, more and more nations are looking for a digital strategy. The market is expanding as a result of rising government measures to encourage e-health solutions, an increase in chronic diseases, and a growing requirement to employ e-health to manage regulatory compliance.\n",
      "Rise of E-health in today’s world\n",
      "According to a poll of more than 11,000 consumers across 16 nations, consumers still view health and fitness as “essentials,” right up there with groceries and domestic cleaning supplies, even in the face of general insecurity and financial difficulties. 80% of poll participants indicated they intended to maintain or increase their spending on areas connected to health and fitness in the coming year, such as exercise classes or vitamins and supplements, even though two-thirds (66%) of respondents stated they feel financially stressed.\n",
      "Source: Accenture consumer public survey\n",
      "Regardless of income levels, people have redefined health and well-being as essential goods and intend to maintain or increase their spending in this area this year, according to Oliver Wright, a senior managing director at Accenture and the global leader of the company’s Consumer Goods & Services industry practice. “With the global spend on health and wellness expected to reach more than $1 trillion by 2025, consumer-facing companies must draw on cross-industry expertise, scientific advancements, and technological innovations while also taking consumers’ shifting priorities into account when developing new offerings.” Thus, as health requirements rise along with innovation, people are more tolerant of e-health.\n",
      "Source: Deloitte\n",
      "Healthcare customers desire both easy access to medical care and positive interactions with their doctors. However, if forced to pick one, they would go with convenience. To address this, more than half of the survey participants expressed interest in implementing solutions that would enhance the consumer experience by lowering the time and difficulty associated with obtaining care. In fact, over the next three to five years, 61% of respondents intend to spend money on patient communication technologies like telehealth and messaging capabilities with their medical staff. Other consumer-specific capabilities that businesses are wanting to invest in at this time include online appointment scheduling and virtual registration.\n",
      "Future of E-health and its role in the Pandemic\n",
      "The system of E-health relies on interoperable digital systems to exchange information on health operations, and in the future, information from these systems might be exchanged between other nations to enhance healthcare administration. This enables inhabitants of one country who travel elsewhere for a vacation to receive better healthcare and medicine prescriptions there. Additionally, this will help the medical tourism sector as well.\n",
      "Robotics and artificial intelligence will be used more frequently in the future. Even though it will be difficult in the future for robots to operate on people, doctors are now utilizing AI to diagnose illnesses. The goal of digital healthcare in the future is to put medical facilities close to the people. M-health technologies can track patients’ vital signs and keep an eye out for anomalies. so that consumers can consult a doctor before the issue worsens This lowers the fatality rate and medical malpractice.\n",
      "The covid-19 pandemic has already demonstrated the value of e-health technology since most hospitals were operating at limited capacity and postponing procedures as a result. As a result, during the epidemic, E-health applications were employed to maintain communication and improve patient care. All of this technology was, however, interoperable and required fast internet connections. To reduce the distance between doctors and patients, internet penetration would rise in the future, for instance with today’s 5G technology.\n",
      "Summing it up\n",
      "Last but not least, a stronger push for digital health may increase confidence in digital healthcare and increase dependence on medical websites. The vaccination movement, which is highly vocal and gaining traction through digital channels, is an example of this. The relationship between the medical staff and the patient is ultimately what drives health and wellness, but in today’s environment, digital platforms are supporting this interaction more than ever. The future standard of treatment might very well include the routine use of digital health instruments.\n",

      "Marketing can be defined as an act of promotion or advertisement of selling products or services. It is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of the consumers by understanding the target consumer market and particular businesses. It has evolved into a new form especially due to the excessive use of social media. Due to the boost in the use of social media, it is easier for businesses to market and advertise their business or the products and services offered by them. It affects both businesses and consumers in a significant manner.\n",
      "How does marketing influence business?\n",
      "In the words of Peter Drucker: “Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two–and only two–basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business.”\n",
      "Marketing doesn’t just “impact” a business – it is the function that saves a company from closing down.\n",
      "Marketing has various benefits for business such as –\n",
      "Marketing your business can have a huge impact on new businesses by creating large barriers for them to enter a well-established market. The new companies, brands, and businesses marketing, and advertisement can play a significant in making consumers aware of the products and services they are offering.\n",
      "While a company can sell out its products to larger customers. With the assistance of various marketing tactics, they can significantly improve their brand awareness and make their product more visible to a larger audience, which in turn increases both sales and revenue. Marketing can help in identifying the buying behavior of consumers as well.\n",

      "This is where conversational marketing can help them reach out to customers effectively and efficiently. It is a powerful way of driving sales and returns on investment (ROI). Brands using this can have a positive impact on their businesses.\n",
      "In no sense, influencer marketing has gained significant attraction in the past one to two years. brands use online influencers for their marketing campaigns through social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. It includes influencers creating content by interacting with the product or services offered or with the employee of the business. Influencer marketing yields better results than conventional celebrity endorsements. They can easily interact with their followers which results in better engagement. Influencer marketing plays a significant role in consumer behavior and psychology such as recommendations. In recent times we have seen various brands like beardo, and Muscleblaze use influencers on Instagram to market their product. The influencers create content about the product and services offered which creates an online marketing campaign for the businesses.\n",
      "The content you post can have a significant impact on the development of the business. Personalized content can result in better consumer interaction. Big businesses like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, etc. are some successful examples. If we take the example of Netflix, it automatically suggests movies and web series on the search history of the user, and the same is done by Spotify. Facebook makes use of an algorithm that determines the kind of content that should be shown on the user’s feed. Amazon makes use of users’ browsing and purchasing history while displaying products when we log in to it. Spotify Wrapped is one of the music streaming service’s most effective content marketing initiatives. Every year, around the New year, Spotify subscribers receive a wonderful compilation of all the songs they’ve listened to.

      "Automation in marketing is making use of technology to automate marketing and advertising efforts. The covid-19 pandemic has significantly increased the use of technology and automation not only in marketing but in other sectors of the business as well. It may sound complex but automation in marketing is simple. Automated email sequences in sales and the upload of social media posts are all examples of Automation in marketing. Marketing automation allows businesses to scale their efforts to reach out to larger customers. More than 30% of business owners claim that marketing automation help with time-saving.  Their marketing team no longer needs to waste time repetitively focusing on tasks and can focus on optimization and content creation. Nissan gathers relevant data about its customers, including the time at which each vehicle was purchased. Six months after the automobile is acquired, they can utilize the purchase date to automatically send a reminder email to schedule the first service visit. This is an essential component of Nissan’s strategy because maintenance costs collected after the sale of the vehicle make up a significant part of Nissan’s overall earnings.\n",
      "By understanding, consumer behavior marketers can fill in the gap of how consumers buy a product and identify the product that is needed ad the obsolete products.\n",
      "Studying consumer behavior can help marketers to present the product in a way that yields higher consumer attraction. Understanding consumer behavior is the key secret to reaching out to more customers for brand recognition, engaging with the clients, and converting those into potential buyers.\n",
      "How marketing influences consumer decisions?\n",
      "The primary responsibility of a marketing department is to grow the market share by acquiring and keeping new clients. The best way to do that is by monitoring, evaluating, and controlling consumer behavior. Modern marketing strategies easily handle this duty. Let’s examine the how and why in more detail.\n",
      "Regularly held marketing initiatives have a significant impact on consumers’ purchase decisions. They pick one brand over another just because they saw the first one’s advertisement more frequently. Customers tend to trust some businesses more than others simply because they have better blogs, and more visually appealing material and employ opinion leaders who help customers associate with the company favorably.\n",
      "Instead of informing consumers, modern marketing aims to convince and build strong emotional bonds with brands and products. Even if people can’t recall where or when they saw a specific advertisement, they may still experience a specific emotion when they look at a product at a store, such as happiness, comfort, or confidence. It occurs because the advertising they watched caused their brain to detect a particular emotion. The brain immediately connected the product with a certain emotion when they first viewed it. When buyers select from a variety of comparable products from various companies, this relationship will operate flawlessly.\n",
      "Nike advertises in a way that makes its customers comfortable. Its tagline, “Just Do It,” speaks for itself. Allowing everybody and everyone to come up with their meaning of the term makes it straightforward but to the point and helps the business build relationships with its customers. The audience is emotionally connected to this slogan.\n",
      "We believe that each of our social, professional, and informational settings is distinct. But in reality, we all live in a world of marketing where everything is offered for sale and purchased. It’s not good or bad; it’s simply the new commercial reality that dictates what you’ll wear tomorrow, how you’ll address your boss, and how much of your income you’ll spend on eating out. With a few notable exceptions, it is generally applicable to everyone, from a young wealthy nerd who is only 20 years old to a family in their late 30s. If you give it some more thought, you’ll realize that most of the material you encounter each day attempts to sell you something, such as a good, idea, an emotion, a political viewpoint, a way of acting, etc. Marketing strategies and tactics in all their forms and guises are what produce this entire environment.\n",
      "Take, for instance, the blogs of modern businesses. Rather than being sales tools, they appear to be thematic media. Companies work to position themselves as the go-to resource for information about a given industry by disseminating their knowledge of it to consumers. In this approach, they produce a ton of content, including viral material that shapes consumer trends and purchasing patterns. Today, public perception and reputation are even more valuable than actual goods. If it has a worthwhile message to convey and is effectively promoted, even a plain chicken egg can become viral and break Instagram records.\n",
      "Source-Instagram\n",
      "Because it informs, equalizes, supports, engages, sells, and expands a business’s operations and offers, marketing is crucial for enterprises. It is equally important in the sense that it greatly influences the potential consumer behavior of the individual. If done correctly marketing can create a huge influence on both businesses and consumers.\n",

      "According to research, the advertisement can increase the market value. Not only offline advertisement, but the world is also going through “Digital advertising” through “social media and many other media’’. With the help of advertising, most people are becoming famous and getting success in their companies.\n",
      "Advertisements can help the company to grow successfully and potentially. For small to big companies advertisement is the only weapon to change the company’s faith and bring success to the company. Nowadays most of them are using digital media for their advertisement and they’re attracting people to their products. It is a flat form for the people to know what product that they launch by the company, and most of them are using social media like “youtube, Facebook, Twitter Now recently Instagram also sponsoring the advertisements while scrolling through the app”. while coming to “nondigital advertising means firstly it will be the Radio, later pamphlets, and newspaper advertisements, announcing through the mike and roaming on the road”, With these the advertisement can help in growing the market value.\n",
      "According to research advertisement can helps increases the market value. A recent study that advertisement will only be the “strongest weapon to the change the market value”. Not only does the advertisement increase the market’s value, it sometimes depends upon the product. with the help of this, it will increase the market value of the company and increases the share value of the company.  Most companies are spending crores and lakhs on their advertisement for increasing the market value and their company value.\n",
      "Presently the following days “celebrities are sponsoring the product and it is a key to the company to increase the market value of the company”. By sponsoring the about their fans buying that product and increasing the market value of the company.  Mostly the main reason for increasing the market value is to show up their product’s specialty and the importance of the product.\n",
      "By giving advertisements some of them believe it is a brand that can now beat the product. And most people think that and buy that product and this is the one type of way that increases the market value of the product. Some of them trust their product and buy their product, and increase the market value.\n",
      "Nowadays advertising is largely expanded through the public area, the internet websites, etc …By advertising, you can know what the product is launched and what is the specialty of their product, after research, the product will be sold in the market with their values and it will help in increase the market value.\n",

      "Negative effects of marketing on society\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "“Society can exist without Marketing, but Marketing cannot exist without Society.”\n",
      "Marketing is the management process of anticipating, identifying, and satisfying customers’ requirements. The various conventional marketing tools are advertising, branding, direct marketing, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations. Critics acknowledge that marketing has legitimate uses in as much as it connects goods and services to consumers who desire them. However, some aspects of marketing, especially promotion and advertisements, are subject to criticism. They argue that product promotion is an attempt by the goods and service providers to influence demand. Advertising has become such an inextricable part of our lives that one cannot imagine life without it. Although we hardly ever notice, advertisements leave an indelible mark on our minds, especially on vulnerable groups like children and adolescents.\n",
      "The commensuration of the two words raises eyebrows in marketing and society, as it is highly debatable. On the one hand, Society thrives on Companies’ marketing efforts, while another school of thought argues that marketing makes society more materialistic. Today, striking a balance between the two is the challenge marketers face. Ethical expectations are a vital part of the business environment. Society expects businesses to be honest and desires corporate executives, at all levels, to apply ethical principles- in other words, guidelines as to what is right and wrong, fair and unfair, and morally correct- when they make business decisions. For better or worse, marketing is everywhere, with the allure of new products, big promises, and hope for something new or different. As we turn on the television or scroll through social media feeds, we will find it hard to avoid someone trying to sell us something. While advertising and marketing share information and tell us what is new, it does so to persuade rather than educate, so their influence can sometimes be more harmful than positive.\n",
      "The debate about the positives and negatives of advertising is a bit like the infamous chicken or egg question. Some people claim that marketing causes adverse effects, while others argue that it merely reflects what is already happening in the culture. For all the positive potential of marketing, the reality is that it frequently influences society in negative ways. One negative aspect of marketing is its potential to feed into unrealistic expectations, breed discontentment, and influence our thought processes in ways beyond our control. Materialism, workaholism, unhealthy lifestyle habits, alcoholism, politics, and unrealistic views negatively shape our culture and impact the most vulnerable.\n",
      "According to research, marketing has become increasingly hostile in the modern television era. Consumers are often disturbed by advertisements & marketing, and negative campaign ads tend to fuel a vicious cycle where both sides fling ads back and forth in a futile, narcissistic, tantrum-like attempt to make their opponents look worse and worse while making themselves look better. Marketing aims to present a product in the best light possible. There is some leeway in the creative process. The problem arises when dramatization crosses the line into falsely representing a product. Hefty fines can result from false advertising when levied by the authorities.\n",
      "Marketing and advertising are ingrained in the modern culture, from children’s programs on Saturday mornings to talk shows and prime-time TV. Advertising even invades movies through product placement. Marketing influences how people feel about themselves and often turns out negative. Widespread concern exists about the potential effects of media portrayals of drinking, alcohol product placements, and alcohol advertising on alcohol consumption and problems among young people. Television, radio, film, and popular music are often identified as potential sources through which young people learn about alcohol and as possible influences on young people’s drinking and drinking problems. Even though campaign advertising has been a part of politics, scholars are still conflicted over the effects of different advertising strategies. As a result, the literature on political advertising is vast and multifaceted. Conventional wisdom holds that political advertising, in general, is harmful to democracy. Further, the adverse effects of advertising on teenagers include increased cigarette and alcohol use, obesity, poor nutrition, and eating disorders, according to Pediatrics, the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n",
      "Advertisers are traditionally using techniques to which children and adolescents are more susceptible, such as product placement in TV shows and tie-ins between movies and fast-food restaurants, to mention a few. It’s all kid’s play anyway, with today’s youngsters having profound influence over purchases in all product categories. Many marketing evils lure people into buying even when not required. However, the picture of the relationship between marketing and society is contested. Marketing has often been criticized for encouraging excessive consumption, self-indulgent lifestyle, and producing a consumer culture where products and services are the core of social identity at the expense of other ‘traditional’ values.\n",
      "Just as in an underdeveloped economy, marketing can be an avenue for publicity of indigenous products and services, thereby generating income; similarly, in developing and developed economies, where competition for the share of the customer’s pocket is high, marketing can lead to attitudinal and lifestyle changes and problems. Free collectible coupons or tattoos inside chips packets, and other such advertising gimmicks and tactics do not add any value to the product being offered but only lure consumers into buying a product they otherwise may not have purchased- leading to another group of people who entice these students to enroll for a weight reduction program! Sex is used in commercials to sell everything from beer to shampoo to cars. New research shows that teenagers’ exposure to sexual content in the media may be responsible for the earlier onset of sexual intercourse or other sexual activities leading to an increased number of HIV-positive cases.\n",
      "Alcohol producers spend $ 5.7 billion/per year on advertising and promotions. Research has found that adolescent drinkers are more likely to have been exposed to alcohol advertising. Studies confirm a direct link between junk food advertisements and obesity among adolescents.\n",
      "As we move ahead with technology and change the marketing strategy with the growing consumerism, it is vital to be cautious. Our cautiousness can only decide what happens in the future regarding marketing.\n",

      "How advertisement/marketing affects business.\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "We are living in 2022 and everything has changed post the years. The whole world is running on two phenomena, either #technology or marketing. In a simple sense, earlier if we had to buy something our choice was clear with respect to the product, its price, brand, even shops from where to purchase, and more such factors. There were not many alternates and substitutes available in the market for anything. But now the scenario has changed and we could find ample alternates and substitutes available in the market and not only that, even we have alternatives to markets as well. Now we even have a choice among the mode of the market to choose from, i.e. either physical market or virtual market. Simultaneously the competition between the businesses has also risen. So a question arises, in such a competitive and dynamic environment how do businesses sustain themselves?\n",
      "The only solution to this question is ADVERTISEMENT / MARKETING. Marketing plays a very important role in the #success and failure of any company. Marketing philosophy is implemented to attract new and existing customers towards their product/service or company. The very common tool used for marketing is advertising. The basic idea behind advertising is to give customers knowledgeable about the product or service in a very interesting and attractive way.\n",
      "Any company should opt for the advertisement model very judiciously. The advertisement tells customers which product they should buy and which to leave. Advertisement affects businesses in a very crucial way as they decide whether a product is ready to play in long run or not. Most of the products are chosen by the customers because of the advertisement only. If businesses don’t advertise then no one will buy their products. Advertisements are the main reason behind the revenues of a company. There are many ways to do advertise through electronic mediums such as televisions, radio, social media, etc., and paper mediums such as newspapers.\n",
      "Wrong advertisements can be harmful to businesses as they provide information in the wrong manner. Instead of being the needs of people, it becomes unnecessary for the people. This could result in a big loss for the company and may also hamper the image of the company. For example, TATA introduced the Nano car in India to have low price car but its marketing went wrong in the eyes of the public and it got failed.\n",
      "So advertising/marketing affects a business in both positive and negative ways.\n",

      "Rising IT cities will impact the economy, environment, infrastructure, and city life by the year 2035\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "2035, urbanization has changed the world as well as the country. India, the world’s third-largest economy after America with China already surpassing the USA and India surpassing Japan to become a larger #economy is now behind China in terms of urbanization with 675 million people living in urbanized cities as compared to China which has 1bn people living in urbanized cities. But what is the cost of urbanization? Social cost? Is it positive or negative? Has it eased our leaving or are we becoming more AI-driven?\n",
      "Technology has always been the driving force for any change in society be it from the industrial revolution in the 18th century to the advancement of the Internet. The world has changed massively and is continuously changing with cities transforming into smart ones with more #opportunities and #betterment of life. Cities change the future and they are the #engines of economic growth and modernization. With half of the world now living in #urban cities. It is this urbanization that is changing the trajectory of growth miraculously. The present cities which are in the top 10 with the highest #GDP share might not be there in the list of 2035. A report by Oxford Economics claims that most of the cities will be from Asia with New York and London still being the leader as it has deep roots in banking and finance institutes. Likewise, Population and demographics can become major assets to a country’s growth. India’s burgeoning working-age demographics will present a #unique advantage for themselves and the country is projected to contain several of the fastest-growing cities in the coming years. If we talk about the annual GDP growth rate of the cities which are likely to top the charts, it is also a surprise for the West. Not a single city is from the West anymore but all are from the Asian block, mainly dominated by India and China, and some cities from Southeast Asia. Bangalore with a massive GDP growth rate of 8.5 percent leads the pack followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore has a colossal amount of talent pool and the startup culture makes it unique on its own. It is safe to say the next Silicon Valley of Asia and the world is Bangalore itself. The amount of startups it generates now is huge. It has the potential to be one of the most urbanized cities in the world. The annual average GDP growth of the entire world, which will be around 2.5 percent, is very minimal for these cities which will surpass it by a fair amount.\n",
      "Surely countries will grow as well as cities will be modernized to cater to the needs of society. Migration from rural to urban has been a key reason for the expansion of urban cities. But if we can maintain a balance between both the environment and sustainable growth, the future would be better for us as well as our future generations. Climate change is real and it’s affecting us. The impacts of climate change will lead to a worsening of environmental conditions in vast regions in the form of extended heat episodes, more erratic rainfall, drought, and flooding. As we are seeing in Europe, China, and Pakistan. Heatwaves in the entire continent of Europe have caused problems in society, likewise, China is experiencing severe heat waves in the country causing rivers to dry up due to which hydroelectricity cannot be generated. Pakistan witnessed an unprecedented amount of floods in the region. Out of 160 districts,110 districts are underwater and a loss of almost 10bn dollars.  These impacts particularly affect rural agrarian and pastoralist communities of society which heavily depend on the environment. With livelihoods being increasingly disrupted by climate change across the globe, climate-driven migration will likely increase. According to the World Bank Groundswell report, Sub-Saharan, and Southeast Asia could see more than 130 million people move within their countries’ making it a massive amount of migration if no urgent global and national climate actions are taken right now.(Rigaud et al., 2018) Urbanization also affects the broader prospects of regional environments. Regions downwind from large industrial complexes also see huge increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the number of days with thunderstorms. Urban areas generate more rain, but they reduce the infiltration of water and thus lower the water tables.\n",
      "Energy consumption for electricity, transportation, cooking, and heating is much higher in urban areas than in rural villages. For example, urban populations nowadays have more cars than rural populations. Almost all of the cars in the world in the 1930s were in the country of the United States. Today we have a car for every two people in that country. China, the United States, and India are the top three countries that contribute to the global greenhouse emitter. If that becomes the norm, in 2050 there would be almost 5.3 billion cars in the world, all using the energy of cars and destroying the environment with their global emission.\n",
      "A large share of migrants will be moving to cities. In many countries, including the G20 ones, urbanization processes are driven by rural-urban migration in response to rapid changes in production, especially manufacturing. India is now trying to catch up with manufacturing after becoming successful in the service sector as it sees an opportunity in front of them. With China 2035 moving towards a more AI-based service sector, it will be the young population of India that will cater to the needs of the world.  Better labor market prospects in urban areas pull in young people, while lack of social and economic opportunities as well as environmental drivers of the society push people out of their rural origins to search for a better and higher standard of living in the urban centers. As a consequence, G20 countries like China, India, and South Africa have seen major urban growth in the past decades. People who live in urban areas have very different consumption patterns than the residents of rural areas. For example, urban populations consume much more amounts of food, energy, and durable goods than rural populations. In China during the 1970s, the urban populations also consumed more than twice as much pork as the rural populations who were raising pigs. With economic development, people now have declined their consumption as the rural populations of the countries ate better diets.\n",
      "The health implications of environmental problems include respiratory infections and other infectious and parasitic diseases. Capital costs for building improved environmental infrastructure are also costly for example, investments in a cleaner public transportation system such as a subway — and for building more hospitals and clinics are higher in cities than people in rural areas, where wages exceed those paid in rural areas and also the cost to avail the services are much higher in urban cities than in rural areas.\n",
      "Infrastructure does play an important role in the process of urbanization. India, which is now aiming toward a 5 trillion economy, is building up a huge infrastructure to support the economy. Infrastructure like roads, bridges, and railway networks are the veins of an economy. Just like China created a pool of massive infrastructures to support the economy  Being a developing country India has to prioritize sectors for their both inclusive as well as exclusive growth and as India moves towards a manufacturing hub, India needs to move towards better network and fast-paced network to support the movement of logistics  Often it is said- roads are the true mirror of the economy as India is moving from highways to expressways it needs to sustain these changes so that shortly you have infrastructures ready to move ahead in leaps and bounds. Therefore, to enable macroeconomic stabilization through the expansion of revenue expenditure, ring-fencing of capital expenditure levels as a share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) becomes critical.\n",
      "Of course, any number of variables could impact these projections of 2035, from financial recessions to wars, food securities to pandemics, and political uncertainty to rapid urbanization and technological advances.\n",
      "But one thing’s certain— it is in these coming decades, cities are where many of these factors will converge and play out on the world stage.\n",

      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "The advancement in technology and proliferation of the Internet has led to the wide exposure of entertainment platforms to a massive audience including teenagers, adults, and senile. In this research paper, we study the impact of Over-the-Top media on society as a whole especially after the pandemic when there was a sudden shift in remote work culture, educational practices being held online, families spending valuable time together, and majorly the access to viewers. Besides the convenience of receiving, the media has certain other advantages too. It has opened up the possibility of streaming ad-free content and undisturbed viewing. Also, the customer is truly the king here; he or she can watch what they want and when they want. However, there have been no studies so far that have examined the impact of OTT media on society, families, and individuals.\n",
      "There has been a prodigious change over the past decade as how there has been a shift of television viewers to Over-the-Top platforms which are now easily accessible to anyone through the internet. The widespread availability of broadband internet has led to the emergence and steady rise to prominence of many platforms, including YouTube, Netflix, and HBO Go. By satisfying media-hungry consumers’ needs and adjusting to their increasingly busy lifestyles, these platforms have found success.\n",
      "The traditional TV-viewing experience is no longer restricted to real-time or the living room TV. Nowadays, users may consume content on laptops, tablets, portable devices, and gaming consoles whenever and wherever they want.  Especially the demand for OTT media and entertainment has seen a concurrent and large increase during the post-pandemic era, with internet usage increasing from 40% to 100% during that time. The widespread lockdowns have contributed to consumer awareness of the potential of OTT media services, enhancing their capacity to influence the daily consumption of content. By offering tailored content recommendations and focused adverts, media firms have also contributed to unlocking additional value for each of their unique viewers by utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Analytics. With the rise of cross-platform smart voice assistants ensuring the creation of a smart home ecosystem within the homes of the consumers, the transitions underway in the media and entertainment space enable customer-friendly easy content search with voice commands through Smart OTT Platforms will enhance customer experience by every passing day.\n",
      "India’s OTT streaming video market is currently in its second growth phase with total revenues of $3 billion in 2022. To know about the impact of OTT platforms in India, it is important to consider consumers’ passive involvement, and interests which helps in analyzing the last action.\n",
      "According to a survey by RBSA Advisors, India’s video OTT market is anticipated to grow from roughly USD 1.5 billion in 2021 to USD 12.5 billion by 2030 as a result of access to better networks, digital connections, and smartphones. According to the survey, Tier II, III, and Tier IV cities and the population who speak Indian languages would be responsible for the next wave of growth in the OTT environment.\n",
      "The significant expenditures made in original and acquired content by OTT services like Netflix, Amazon, Disney+ Hotstar, and others will assist subscription video-on-demand in making up 93% of the total OTT income (as opposed to 87%) while expanding at a CAGR of 30.7% between 2019 and 2024.\n",

      "Rise of Electric Vehicles and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "In 2020 India became the 5th largest automobile market in the world. While this fact is good news for the automobile industry, it is also bad news for the environment. How? Well, India is also the 3rd largest oil-consuming and Green House Gas (GHG) emitting nation. According to the Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), during the 2020 lockdown, even though the complete economy was shut yet 36 out of 50 big cities in India had unhealthy air quality.\n",
      "Taking into account the current situation where according to studies, vehicles annually contribute about 290 Giga grams of PM2, at the same time, around 8 percent of total GHG (Green House Gas) Emissions in India are from the transport sector and in Delhi, it exceeds 30 percent and also in the account of the promises made by India on decreasing Carbon emissions NITI Ayog wants to electrify India’s 2W segment by 2025 and the 3W segment by 2030. India has aimed to create 100 percent Electric Vehicle (EV) use by 2030. While experts say that this goal is quite ambitious and a hybrid of both Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) may be seen in India for another decade but India is ushering itself towards its goal in a much faster fashion. And let me give you a few reasons behind it:\n",
      " So basically, since the war between Ukraine and Russia seems to be never-ending and Russia is an exporter of crude petroleum to the world, the rates of petroleum in the International market are skyrocketing and India is the 3rd largest oil-consuming nation and 90 percent of this oil is being imported, a lot of India’s money is being driven towards that which needs to be controlled. Moreover, after the lockdown people are trying to stay at distance from each other and thus the people who can afford are trying to use personal vehicles instead of public ones. This is why India is on its way to becoming the largest market for automobiles, given the population. The effect of rising oil prices (touching the 100rs mark now and then) can be seen in other products as well, transportation costs increasing inflation of course.\n",
      "Therefore the government is hoping to control our import bills with EVs (Electric Vehicles) and Hydrogen Running Vehicles. But (no matter what is being said, there’s always a but in India) here’s a catch if the hasty push is being done then that may further increase our country’s import bill. How? Well, currently most of the EV components are imported from China, yet nothing much to worry about, huge Indian Automobile Industries are trying to make EVs (Electric Vehicles) completely made in India, you just need to be informed and smart consumer.\n",
      "Now let’s see what the government is doing about the issue currently:\n",
      " Since battery costs 70 percent of the total manufacturing cost of an EV (Electrical Vehicle), MoRTH (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways) is considering ‘Battery as a service business model. The government has allotted a budget of about 100 crores in its latest budget. The government is working on applying the Fame II Policy wherein it will spend 86 percent on Consumer Incentives and 10 percent on Charging Infrastructure. The government is trying to attract FDIs and take help with the import of Li (Lithium) to make batteries. The government has also promised to build charging infrastructure.\n",
      "The government has also launched an e-portal that is e-amrit.niti.gov on COP26 Summit in Glasgow. The portal gives an insight into the major benefits of using EVs (Electric Vehicles). The major benefits talked about are:\n",
      " Zero Tailpipe Emission (ZTE) Lower Running Cost Lower Maintenance Less Tax Environmental Benefits Easy to Drive Quite\n",
      "You might feel that the government is adamant about its “ICE to EV by 2030” mission, yet let’s talk about what government can add to this mission. The double Dividend Hypothesis by David Pearce in 1991 states that environmentaltaxation can improve economic and environmental conditions and recyclingrevenues obtained to reduce other pre-existing taxes. Norway provides no toll and free parking to people using EVs as an incentive. Sweden and France give tax levitation to people using EVs.\n",
      "Now let’s chitchat a bit upon the problems that consumers think might come if they switch toEVs: Short driving range of EVs Long Battery Recharge Time Lack of charging Infrastructure Higher cost Battery life High cost of commercial electricity Poor roads\n",
      "If India is looking forward to an EV future then it has to build a good road network because it isproven that carbon emission by ICE is lesser on good roads and the driving range of EVs is alsogreater on good roads.\n",
      "Now let’s talk about how will this affect livelihood in the future that is by 2040. So let me give yousome of my and some of the expert’s predictions to conclude this article : According to Crew Report demand for power is expected to rise by 80 percent. About 75 percent of vehicles will be EVs. This will usher in the use of Railways for large distances. Let’s not forget air transport as well. Transportation cost of goods to decrease Imports to decrease in large amounts. Empty petrol stations (better if converted to charging stations) And me writing and you reading about self-solarized EVs.\n",
      "The last one was obvious (chuckles) but since you have read me so far, allow me to share a small, additional yet important information that will be summarized by my last prediction. So, there is this EV trade route that happens to have the Philippines, Japan, and the US. And here The Philippines extracts Ni (Nickel) for batteries of EVs from Rio Tuba, a mine, Japan purifies it and The US makes batteries out of them and uses them in EVs. Now since demand is increasing, the mining of Rio Tuba is increasing too which is affecting the Rainforests of the Philippines and its ecosystem, making us question “Is it even a solution?”\n",
      "And here I predict: High prices and nonavailability of batteries and their parts in the world.\n",

      "Additionally, the electrification of other forms of road transportation continues to increase. Around 25% of all two-wheelers on the road around the globe are electric, however, this trend is mostly restricted to China, India, and ASEAN nations. The world’s worst air quality is in India. Even during the Covid crisis in 2020, when there were national and state lockdowns, 36 of the 50 cities with bad air quality were in India. Internal combustion engines (ICE), in particular, have greatly worsened vehicular pollution as a result of the growing number of private automobiles on Indian roads.\n",
      "India is now the third-highest oil consumer and GHG emitter in the world due to the rise in the stock of ICE automobiles. To prevent it electrification of cars and other vehicles is a must. According to a number of studies, impediments to EV adoption may arise from the distinctions between EV and ICE features.\n",
      "According to surveys, one of the major obstacles to EV adoption’s rapid growth is the vehicles’ limited driving range. Long battery recharge times and a lack of charging infrastructure also have an impact on demand. Longer EV driving ranges, quick recharge periods, and an expansion of the charging infrastructure, however, may eventually result inless significant problems.However, EV popularity is mostly driven by features like high environmental friendliness, quick acceleration, and cheaper maintenance and fuel expenses. China, a pioneer in the production of lithium-ion batteries, is gaining from the increase in interest in EV battery packs. By establishing the ambitious target of having enough batteries available to fulfill its own demand by 2024, the European Union is making an effort to catch up. Plans from several countries The prediction predicts that by 2030, the annual lithium-ion battery consumption for EVs would surpass 1,748-gigawatt hours (GWh).\n",
      "By 2025, the manufacture of battery cells will have reached 1 trillion watt hours (TWh), according to the capacity projections that have been currently stated. Starting with the surroundings. Depending on the assessment, the automobile industry is thought to produce between 10 and 25 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions. These contaminants, which are presently concentrated in the Earth’s atmosphere at their greatest levels in the past 650,000 years, are all related to climate change.\n",
      "By the end of this century, according to studies, the Earth’s temperature is likely to increase by much more than two degrees Celsius unless considerable changes are made to the world’s industry, energy supply, and consumer habits. These pollutants also caused local pollution and smog, which harmed public health and congested big cities. It was thus no coincidence that automakers started offering alternatively powered vehicles that generated reduced emissions by combining internal combustion engines with electric motors just as the widespread public uproar in reaction to this trend started to grow.\n",
      "With the introduction of the hybrid Prius in Japan in 1997, Toyota was the first to truly seize this market. In general, there are 4 types of Electric vehicles in the market i.e.Hybrid electric vehicles, Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, All-Electric vehicles, and conventional vehicles.Charging an electric vehicle is always less expensive than purchasing petrol for a conventional vehicle. There is no need for gasoline, saving you money on petrol. The cost of $0.10 per kW is the same as paying less than $1 per gallon of petrol to drive. Driving electric vehicles saves drivers, on average, $700 in gasoline expenditures per year.since they don’t release toxins, they are environmentally beneficial. More than 177,758,804 kg of CO2 emissions have been cut by electric car drivers. fewer repairs because of an effective electric motor.\n",
      "You save on running costs since electric motors have fewer components and cause less damage than conventional, non-electric vehicles. Greater Efficiency, In addition to being lighter, electric vehicles also accelerate more quickly.The best electric car ever made is the Tesla Model 3 with 20″ Überturbine Wheels, Performance Brakes and Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive are available for complete control in all weather.\n",
      "The Model 3 can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (mph) in as little as 3.1 seconds because of a carbon fiber spoiler that increases stability at high speeds. In order to increase redundancy, the Tesla All-Wheel Drive incorporates two separate motors, each of which has just one moving element for optimal longevity and low maintenance. They digitally manage torque to the front and back wheels, unlike conventional all-wheel drive systems, providing far superior handling and traction control.\n",
      "A fantastic approach to save money and support a stable and healthy environment is to drive an electric vehicle like the Nissan Leaf, Ford Focus Electric, Tesla Model S, or Chevrolet Volt. Due to the large number of carbon emissions produced by cars, which are released into the atmosphere, we are more susceptible to pollution and greenhouse gases. The ecology is greatly improved by using electric vehicles. Additionally, since electric vehicleshave no environmental effect, they are good for the environment and the economy. There are many elements, but that doesn’t mean they have to be overpowering. You can make an informed choice going ahead by doing a good deal of study on various models, including hybrids. Any way you look at it, an electric vehicle can protect our fragile ecosystem.\n",

      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "We are in an interconnected world. Any change in one part of the world will always lead to some #changes in other parts of the world as well, maybe a bit later but surely there will be some change and that is what we are seeing in today’s world. Electric vehicles are the change that we are seeing in today’s world. With so many advancements in technology, economies are getting bigger. China might surpass the US and become a #superpower, we will have India inching towards a 15 trillion economy by 2040 and there will be competition among themselves to outshine the other. We are also seeing a paradigm shift toward a more multipolar world from a unipolar world where powers are moving towards certain clusters of the world and everyone wants to be a part of these clusters. But in all these rearrangements taking place. We are in a way creating a better and more sustainable life for our present as well as our future generations.\n",
      "We have witnessed the COP26 where we saw leaders of top countries taking pledges to create a more sustainable future and the answer lies in a safer and greener planet and electric vehicles occupy a huge chunk of it. Internal combustion engines have already peaked, and electric vehicles are getting cheaper and cheaper as governments of every country are actively pushing for electric vehicles as we have seen the joint statement in Cop 26 that “As business fleet owners and operators, or shared mobility platforms, we will work towards 100% of our car and van fleets being zero emission vehicles by 2030, or earlier”. This is a step towards the future. India which is home to a large number of two-wheelers and three-wheelers constitutes more than 70% of global sales and more than 80% in India is also a signatory to this statement.   And if we analyze it properly- crude oil, coal, and gas are the most demanded natural resource still in the world. But it’s not free and with the latest scenarios in and around the world, it’s #better to switch to a more safe, efficient, and affordable electric vehicle.\n",
      "If we look at the economic aspects of electric vehicles, it will surely improve the livelihood of society and in turn the world. EVs are on track to rise to 20% of China’s total market by 2025, up from 6% in 2020, and to 37% in the EU, from 11% last year. In the U.S., they are forecast to reach 10% by 2025. India is also not lagging. India’s EV market is still nascent and is forecast to record a 2.4% CAGR from 2020 to 2025. Electrification is expected to penetrate cars and last-mile connectivity modes like two-wheelers in India by 2030. It is expected about 70% of two-wheeler fleets and 30% of private two-wheelers to be electric by 2030. For passenger vehicles, 40% of fleets and 15%-20% of private cars will be electric by that time.  There are also different steps taken by the government like #tax exemptions, schemes like PLI, FAME, and battery swapping policy. We must also note that it is estimated that around 10 million direct jobs will be created and indirectly almost 50 million jobs will be created around this sector. If we look at the global picture we are also seeing that there is a price parity between battery vehicles and ICE vehicles and with so many advancements in technology we are seeing the prices of batteries coming down with more players getting involved in it with prices estimated to be further down.\n",
      "As a world leader, countries like China and the USA are in a race to build more lithium-ion batteries so that they are self-sufficient and have the capabilities to further rise to the occasion of being a major exporters in the world. The European Union is also not lagging as they are also trying to catch up by producing enough batteries to be self-sufficient by 2025.\n",
      "Crude oils are increasing day by day. We have seen a shortage of gas in European countries mainly due to the Russia- Ukraine war and everybody is trying to find an alternative to gas and crude oil as it is harmful and it’s one of the main reasons why pollution is such a havoc in the world. One of the major problems of Crude oils is oil spilling which is endangering marine species. Air pollution caused due to petrol and diesel vehicles is also affecting our planet and if there is less oil then there is less pollution as alternative drivetrains, fuel economy, and shared mobility will impact oil demand; however, nations still won’t reach net-zero by 2050 without doing more. Coal is also a great contributor to this pollution Environmental impacts associated with using coal as an energy source are particulate emission, ground-level ozone, smog, and acid rain. Coal and fuel oil combustion emit fly ash particles into the atmosphere, which contribute to air pollution problems. Though it is said that prices of crude oil haven’t peaked yet, they will surely peak by 2040. So, we need to foresee the future to have an alternative in society though we still can’t reach a complete outwash of oil in 2050 we can make sure that other alternatives are ready and self-sufficient.\n",
      "Well, job opportunities are also a major reason why we should consider EVs as our future. We realize that the max range of an electric vehicle will be around 350-390 km so people need to stop somewhere to recharge their batteries for at least 40-50 minutes which can provide a time frame in which people can avail restaurants explore shopping complexes and what not. This will help in generating employment opportunities in #hubs like these. There is also a rush in countries like China, the USA, and the European Union to build charging stations like this which will accelerate the process of EV vehicles. In this fast, paced world almost every alternative family is having a car but if public vehicles like buses and trains can be changed into electric vehicles this can boost the economy as a whole by creating greater needs with more opportunities in these sectors such as transportation and communication are very much a building block of today’s nation-building process.\n",
      "However, if we are talking about a world that is greener and fitter we must realize and understand that Electric vehicles do have a cost to this planet. There is a huge amount of electric waste which is not so concerning in today’s world. It might be a concern in the world we are all planning to live in. Electric vehicles and batteries need rare materials which are not easy to find. Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, is any electronic product, or product containing electronic components, that has reached the end of its usable life cycle. Unbeknownst to many consumers, electronics contain toxic substances – therefore they must be handled with care when no longer wanted or needed. There are also negative effects on soil When the improper disposal of e-waste in regular landfills or in places where it is dumped illegally, both heavy metals and flame retardants can seep directly from the e-waste into the soil, causing contamination of underlying groundwater or contamination of crops that may be planted nearby or in the area in the future. Therefore, we must also not only focus on solely electric vehicles but also on other kinds of fuels like green hydrogen fuels like ethanol which can be generated from agricultural waste. Companies play an important part in this change. Rather than making it only electric, they should try to make vehicles that are hybrid in nature. They can switch engines so that they are ready to switch from petrol or diesel to green hydrogen and ethanol and also to electric vehicles. The future is now…It’s time to act!\n",

      "An outlook of healthcare by the year 2040, and how it will impact human lives.\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "Are you afraid that robots will take over the jobs of nurses, doctors, and other healthcareprofessionals? Are you scared that artificial intelligence will control the world within acouple of years?COVID-19 has revealed how vulnerable the health care industry is to change and its need for structural and technological transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unwelcome reminder of just how much health matters not only to individuals and society but also to the global economy. Improved health accounted for about one-third of the overall GDP per capita growth of developed economies in the past century.\n",
      "The traditional boundaries of the industry will dissolve and new roles will emerge in the future of health as exponential innovation propels the industry towards 2040. By 2040, health care as we know it today will no longer exist. There will be a fundamental shift from “health care” to “health.” And while disease will never be eliminated, through science, data, and technology, we can identify it earlier, intervene proactively, and better understand its progression to help consumers more effectively and actively sustain their well-being.\n",
      "The future will be focused on wellness and managed by companies that assume new roles to drive value in the transformed health ecosystem. As the rate of technological evolution continues to speed up, companies need to look ahead and proactively plan for the future. For the healthcare industry, in particular, this need is even more pressing as it is compounded by the pace of declining health in our society. Ray Hammond commented on what healthcare will look like in 2040:\n",
      "“Healthcare is one of the few arenas in which every one of us has a stake. The next 20 years will witness a profound change in healthcare, all the more notable given that medical science and healthcare delivery tend to be conservative, slow-moving sectors that are highly resistant to change. The annual global market is currently estimated to be worth around $8.1 trillion, with annual global spending on healthcare forecast to rise to $18.28 trillion by 2040.\n",
      "With that in mind, we have a collective responsibility to ourselves and to the next generation to determine what that change will look like and the impact it will have on all of us.” How exactly does better health promote economic growth? First, fewer people are likely to die prematurely so the working-age population will increase. When people are healthier, absences from sickness decline and workers are less distracted by managing their conditions or those of their loved ones. Also, fewer workers retire early because of health conditions.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has hit people with underlying health conditions hardest—for example, diabetes, hypertension, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and obesity, which are common across most of the world’s economies. We can improve the health of the world’s population, and that would not only build resilience against future pandemics but also dramatically improve the quality of life of millions of people who suffer the heavy dailythe toll of chronic conditions.\n",
      "Actions or programs such as adopting healthy behavior, expanding access to primary care, and improving medication adherence—could reduce the global disease burden by 40% over 20 years. We found that such a reduction of the disease burden would deliver tremendous benefits: a 65-year-old in 2040 could be as healthy as a 55-year-old today, infant mortality would decline by 65% and 230 million more people would be alive in 2040. More than 70% of the health benefits would come from prevention through healthier environments, healthier behavior, and preventive care (including safe childbirth, vaccination, and adherence to medications that lower risk) rather than treatment of diseases.\n",
      "One way to improve health is to invest in communities so that children can grow up to live long and healthy lives as adults. The remaining 30% of the benefits we found would come from proven therapies to treat existing health conditions. “Future health care and wellbeing” report authored by internationally renowned futurologist, Ray Hammond presents the likely future developments and trends in healthcare between now and 2040.\n",
      "Among the report’s key healthcare predictions for 2040 are:\n",
      "• Health information from traditional annual physical check-ups and other tests previously only available in surgery or lab will be replaced by data from sensors on/around our ‘smart’ bodies (including in our clothing and, eventually, skin and blood). This will be immediately accessible to us, in real-time.• A new field of ‘predictive medical data mining’ will provide early warnings of physiological trouble ahead or indications of disease as it develops. Physicians will have 24/7 real-time reports of their patients’ wellbeing and will be alerted to any change in patients’ data that requires urgent attention.• Stem-cell medicine will be a powerful tool in mainstream medicine. For example, replacement human organs for transplant will be grown on demand from stem cells in the lab, with minimal risk of rejection• Nano-medicine (in its infancy in 2019) may eventually outperform all other branches of medical science, as scientists create ‘designer drugs that are far more powerful than today’s drugs• Artificial Intelligence (AI) ‘chatbots’ equipped with deep learning algorithms could relieve emergency room personnel of tending to large numbers of walk-in patients with non-emergencies (e.g. sore throats, UTIs).\n",
      "\n",
      "The 10 archetypes will fall into three distinct, but interconnected, categories:\n",
      "• Data and platforms: These archetypes will be the foundational infrastructure that forms the backbone of tomorrow’s health ecosystem. They will generate insights for decision-making. Everything else will build off of the data and platforms that underpin consumer-driven health.• Well-being and care delivery: These archetypes will be the most health-focused of the three groupings made up of care facilities and health communities—both virtual and physical, and will provide consumer-centric delivery of products, care, wellness, and well-being.\n",
      "• Care enablement: These archetypes will be connectors, financers, and regulators thathelp make the industry’s “engine” run.\n",
      "All three components need to be fully functioning and integrated for the future of health to come to life.The future of healthcare is shaping up in front of our very eyes with advances in digital healthcare technologies, such as artificial intelligence, VR/AR, 3D printing, robotics, and nanotechnology.\n",
      "We have to familiarize ourselves with the latest developments to be able to control technology and not the other way around. The future of healthcare lies in working hand-in-hand with technology and healthcare workers have to embrace emerging healthcare technologies to stay relevant in the coming years. So it is worth starting “the future” with the betterment of our health through digital technologies, as well as changing our attitude towards the concept of health as such and towards medicine and healthcare.\n",

      "AI in healthcare to Improve Patient Outcomes\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "“If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it will be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles but microbes.” Bill Gates’s remarks at a TED conference in 2014, right after the world had avoided the Ebola outbreak. When the new, unprecedented, invisible virus hit us, it met an overwhelmed and unprepared healthcare system and oblivious population. This public health emergency demonstrated our lack of scientific consideration and underlined the alarming need for robust innovations in our health and medical facilities. For the past few years, artificial intelligence has proven to be of tangible potential in the healthcare sectors, clinical practices, translational medical and biomedical research.\n",
      "After the first case was detected in China on December 31st 2019, it was an AI program developed by BlueDot that alerted the world about the pandemic. It was quick to realise AI’s ability to analyse large chunks of data could help in detecting patterns and identifying and tracking the possible carriers of the virus.\n",
      "Many tracing apps use AI to keep tabs on the people who have been infected and prevent the risk of cross-infection by using AI algorithms that can track patterns and extract some features to classify or categorise them.\n",
      "So how does AI do that?\n",
      "IBM Watson, a sophisticated AI that works on cloud computing and natural language processing, has prominently contributed to the healthcare sector on a global level. Being a conversational AI, since 2013, Watson has helped in recommending treatments to patients suffering from cancer to ensure that they get the best treatment at optimum costs.\n",
      "Researchers at Google Inc. showed that an AI system can be trained on thousands of images to achieve physician-level sensitivity.\n",
      "By identifying the molecular patterns associated with disease status and its subtypes, gene expression, and protein abundance levels, machine learning methods can detect fatal diseases like cancer at an early stage. Machine Learning (ML) techniques focus mainly on analyzing structured data, which can further help in clustering patients’ traits and infer the probability of disease outcomes. Since patient traits mainly include masses of data relating to age, gender, disease history, disease-specific data like diagnostic imaging and gene expressions, etc, ML can extract features from these data inputs by constructing data analytical algorithms.\n",
      "ML algorithms are either supervised or unsupervised. Unsupervised learning helps in extracting features and clustering similar features together that further leads to early detection of diseases. Clustering and principal component analysis enable grouping or clustering of similar traits together that are further used to maximize or minimize the similarity between the patients within or between the clusters. Since patient traits are recorded in multiple dimensions, such as genes, principal component analysis(PCA) creates the apparatus to reduce these dimensions which humans could have not done alone.\n",
      "Supervised learning considers the outcomes of the subjects together with the traits, and further correlates the inputs with the outputs to predict the probability of getting a particular clinical event, expected value of a disease level or expected survival time, or risk of Down’s syndrome.\n",
      "Biomarker panels that are mostly used to detect ovarian cancer, have outperformed the conventional statistical methods due to machine learning. In addition to this, the use of EHRs and Bayesian networks, which are a part of supervised machine learning algorithms, can predict clinical outcomes and mortality respectively.\n",
      "Unstructured data such as clinical notes and texts are converted into machine-readable structured data with the help of natural language processing(NLP). NLP works with two components: text processing and classification. Text processing helps in identifying a series of disease-relevant keywords in clinical notes and then through classification are further categorized into normal and abnormal cases. Chest screening through ML and NLP has helped find abnormalities in the lungs and provide treatment to covid patients. Healthcare organizations use NLP-based chatbots to increase interactions with patients, keeping their mental health and wellness in check.\n",
      "Deep learning is a modern extension of the classical neural network techniques which helps explore more complex non-linear patterns in data, using algorithms like convolution neural network, recurrent neural network, deep belief network, and deep neural network which enables more accurate clinical prediction. When it comes to genome interpretation, deep neural networks surpass the conventional methods of logistics regression and support vector machines.\n",
      "Sepsis Watch is an AI system trained in deep learning algorithms that holds the capability to analyze over 32 million data points to create a patient’s risk score and identify the early stages of sepsis.\n",
      "Another method known as the Learning-based Optimization of the Under Sampling Pattern( LOUPE) is based on integrating full resolution MRI scans with the convolutional neural network algorithm, which helps in creating more accurate reconstructions.\n",
      "Robotic surgery is widely considered in most delicate surgeries like gynaecology and prostate surgery. Even after striking the right balance between human decisions and AI precision, robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency as they have to be manually operated through a console. Thus, autonomous robotic surgery is on the rise with inventions such as robotic silicon fingers that mimic the sense of touch that surgeons need to identify organs, cut tissues, etc., or robotic catheters that can navigate whether it is touching blood, tissue, or valve.\n",
      "Researchers at Children’s National Hospital, Washington have already developed an AI called Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR), which performs a colon anastomosis on its own with the help of an ML-powered suturing tool, that automatically detects the patient’s breathing pattern to apply suture at the correct point.\n",
      "Cloud computing in healthcare has helped in retrieving and sharing medical records safely with a reduction in maintenance costs. Through this technology doctors and various healthcare workers have access to detailed patient data that helps in speeding up analysis ultimately leading to better care in the form of more accurate information, medications, and therapies.\n",
      "How can It help in Biomedical research?\n",
      "Since AI can analyze literature beyond readability, it can be used to concise biomedical research. With the help of ML algorithms and NLP, AI can accelerate screening and indexing of biomedical research, by ranking the literature of interest which allows researchers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses far more precisely and quickly. Taking it to the next level, AI systems like the computational modelling assistant (CMA) helps researchers to construct simulation models from the concepts they have in mind. Such innovations have majorly contributed to topics such as tumour suppressor mechanisms and protein-protein interaction information extraction.\n",
      "AI as precision medicine\n",
      "Since precision medicine focuses on healthcare interventions to individuals or groups of patients based on their profile, the various AI devices pave the way to practice it more efficiently. With the help of ML, complex algorithms like large datasets can be used to predict and create an optimal treatment strategy.\n",
      "Deep learning and neural networks can be used to process data in healthcare apps and keep a close watch on the patient’s emotional state, food intake, or health monitoring.\n",
      "“Omics” refers to the collective technologies that help in exploring the roles, relationships of various branches ending with the suffix “omics” such as genomics, proteomics, etc. Omics-based tests based on machine learning algorithms help find correlations and predict treatment responses, ultimately creating personalized treatments for individual patients.\n",
      "How it helps in psychology and neuro patients\n",
      "For psychologists studying creativity,  AI is promising new classes of experiments that are developing data structures and programs and exploring novel theories on a new horizon. Studies show that  AI can conduct therapy sessions, e-therapy sessions, and assessments autonomously, also assisting human practitioners before, during, or after sessions. The Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signal project uses ML, computer vision, and NLP to analyze language, physical gestures, and social signals to identify cues for human distress. This ground-breaking technology assesses soldiers returning from combat and recognizes those who require further mental health support. In the future, it will combine data captured during face-to-face interviews with information on sleeping, eating, and online behaviours for a complete patient view.\n",
      "Stroke identification\n",
      "Stroke is another frequently occurring disease that affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Thrombus,  in the vessel cerebral infarction is the major (about 85%) cause of stroke occurrence. In recent years, AI techniques have been used in numerous stroke-related studies as early detection and timely treatment along with efficient outcome prediction can help solve the problem. With AI at our disposal, large amounts of data with rich information, more complications and real-life clinical questions can be addressed in this arena. Currently, two ML algorithms- genetic fuzzy finite state machine and PCA were implemented to build a model building solution. These include a human activity recognition stage and a stroke onset detection stage. An alert stroke message is activated as soon as a movement significantly different from the normal pattern is recorded. ML methods have been applied to neuroimaging data to assist disease evaluation and predicting stroke treatment for the diagnosis.\n",
      "Patient Monitoring\n",
      "Today, the market for AI-based patient monitoring is impressive and monetarily enticing. It is evolving with artificial sensors, smart technologies and explores everything from brain-computer interfaces to nanorobotics. Companies with their smart-watches have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not “patients”. An obvious place to start is with wearable and embedded sensors, glucose monitors, pulse monitors, oximeters, and ECG monitors. With patient monitoring becoming crucial, AI finds numerous applications in chronic conditions, intensive care units, operating rooms, emergency rooms, and cardiac wards where timeless clinical decision-making can be measured in seconds. More advances have started to gain traction like smart prosthetics and implants. These play an impeccable role in patient management post-surgery or rehabilitation. Demographics, laboratory results and vital signs can also be used to predict cardiac arrest, transfer into the intensive care unit, or even death. In addition, an interpretable machine-learning model can assist anesthesiologists in predicting hypoxaemia events during surgery. This suggests that with deep-learning algorithms, raw patient-monitoring data could be better used to avoid information overload and alert overload while enabling more accurate clinical prediction and timely decision-making.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Considering the vast range of tasks that an AI can do, it is evident that it holds deep potential in improving patient outcomes to skyrocketing levels. Using sophisticated algorithms AI can bring a revolution in the healthcare sector. Even after facing challenges like whether the technology will be able to deliver the promises, ethical measures, training physicians to use it, standard regulations etc, the role of AI in transforming the clinical practices cannot be ignored. The biggest challenge is the integration of AI in daily practice. All of these can be overcome and within that period the technologies will mature making the system far more enhanced and effective.\n",

      "What if the Creation is Taking Over the Creator?\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "Human minds, a fascination in itself carrying the potential of tinkering nature with the pixie dust intelligence, creating and solving the mysteries and wonders with anything but admiration. However, no matter how captivating a human mind can be, it could sometimes be appalled. It could be the hunger or maybe the desire to want more, to go beyond and unravel the limitations, or maybe something like pure greed. Humans have never stopped and always keep evolving when it comes to intelligence and this is what makes them the supreme.\n",
      "Intelligence calls out for supremacy and so, what if there was to evolve something that opposed a challenge to the very human minds, to their capabilities while making them question their own importance among themselves? Artificial Intelligence came as a revolution, havoc when it first came to the light. The concept of making machines does work on their own, like granting machines –The Intelligence.\n",
      "The idea of making machines work like humans came back in the 19s. Back then people didn’t believe in such a thing as making a non-living thing work, think, and carry tasks on its own, not to mention, to actually surpass humans themselves in those skills. The facts are it did. By 1997. The greatest chess player, Garry Kasparov was defeated in a chess game by a machine and this is where exactly, a top skilled human lost to a mere machine created by another who by himself could’ve never defeated him. It was a rule of power, of betterment, of skills, and the granted supremacy. Were AI and Machines just tools? Equipment?  Something that helped an unskilled person with his mind and intelligence creates something that could do the skilled work for him with perfection and precision? Well initially it was, however, as time passed as humans got drawn to the puzzle of AI, a lot changed. Human research went deeper and deeper and as a result, the machines evolved with it.\n",
      "At present, AI & Machines is a growing field. As it develops and improves, it has become a part of the industrial revolution. In industries, most of the laborious work that was once taken care of by humans was now replaced by machines. Naturally, with the evolution in machines, its precision, mass productivity, quality control, time efficiencies, and all the other factors made it a better choice. A choice over humans.\n",
      "This led to fear, a fear of a not-so-distant future, a future where maybe machines will be so evolved that they’ll take over the need of a human employee leading to unemployment. With the population increase around the world, it became the new tech threat for the labor market. Then again… how true is it? Does AI really oppose a threat? Will adapting to technology make millions of people lose their jobs? Will it lead to mass unemployment? Will the machines really surpass humans? Will, the creation take over the creator?\n",
      "No matter how fearful the future with AI may seem, in reality, it is not that scary. Truth is AI is the present reality, it is the key that holds the power to unlock a whole next level of human evolution. Technology is growing. There was a time where technology was just an idea, but today that idea has been implemented, it’s working and is carried out. Nobody could stop the advancement and growth of Artificial Intelligence, it’s a wave that is already flowing and we as the present generation and the generations to come to have to learn, to learn to swim in this flow and avoid drowning.\n",
      "Many jobs will be replaced by machines, as AI evolves it’ll keep challenging human minds and their skills. With the present COVID 19 situation, contactless cashiers to robots delivering packages have already taken over the usual routine tasks. The jobs of Secretaries, Schedulers, and book-keeper are at risk too. Manufacturing units, agriculture, food services, retail, transportation & logistic, and hospitality are all a part of the AI-affected automation. At an estimation, it is said that around 20 million jobs, especially including manufacturing will be lost to robots. As AI, robotics, 3D printing, and genetics make their way in, even the architects, medical docs, and music composers feel threatened by technology. Making us question that will AI even edge us out of our brain jobs too? Now that can be terrifying.\n",
      "However, as much as machines will be replacing few jobs, they’ll also be creating new jobs.  With the economic growth, innovation, and investment around 133 million jobs are said to be generated. These newly enhanced jobs are to create benefits and amplify one’s creativity, strategy, and entrepreneurial skills. So what is the catch?\n",
      "Well, it’s the skills. Even though AI is creating 3 times more jobs than it is destroying, it’s the skills that count. AI surged in new job opportunities, opportunities like Senior Data Scientist, Mobile Application Developer, and SEO specialist. These jobs were once never heard of but now with AI it’s born, however, to do these jobs or for its qualification, one needs high-level skills and to acquire those skills can be an expensive and time-consuming task. The future generation might be able to cope up with it but the real struggle is to be faced by the present two generations. It’s the vulnerability between the skill gap and unemployment and the youths are the ones to be crushed the most.\n",
      "Therefore, as the advancement of AI becomes inevitable there remains no choice but to adapt, learn, equip ourselves and grow with it. The companies have to work together to build an AI-ready workplace. They should collaborate with the government, educators, and non-profit organizations and work together to bring out policies that could help understand the technologies’ impacts faster while also providing the employees some security. The economic and business planning should be made considerable for minimizing the impact on local jobs and properly maximizing the opportunities.\n",
      "The employees should be provided with proper tools to carry along with the new opportunities while acquiring AI-based skills for their day-to-day work. New skills should be identified and implemented for the upskilling and continual learning initiatives. Employees will have to maximize their Robotic Quotient and learn core skills. They’ll have to adapt to new working models and understand their roles in the coming future.\n",
      "Howsoever, it’s not like AI will totally take over control, even though AI proves to be a better choice, it still has its limitations at present. First, it’s expensive, secondly, manufacturing machines in bulk is not good for the environment. Machines are also very high maintenance, therefore human labor will often come cheaper and so will be considered over machines. Underdeveloped countries will find it hard to equip their people with the upskilling and reskilling required for AI workplace and so for AI to play a role in those countries, might take years. AI can also be risky and unethical, as it’s hard to figure out who to be held responsible for in cases where an AI went wrong.\n",
      "No matter, how advanced AI gets, there are some skills where humans will always have an upper hand i.e., soft skills. Skills like teamwork, communication, creativity, and critical thinking are something that AI hasn’t been able to beat us up to yet and so the value of creativity, leadership, and emotional intelligence has increased. Although, with machines coming in between humans causing the lack of human-to-human interaction, the humans seem to fade away a little.\n",
      "With this era, comes the need for good leaders. Leaders who are capable of handling both machines and humans together, the ones who are organized enough to manage the skilled and the unskilled employees while providing the unskilled trainees with proper training. Leaders who hold profound soft skills and encourage teamwork while working along with machines. The ones who are patient, calm, and optimized.\n",
      "In conclusion, yes AI and machines are going to be very challenging but there’s nothing humans haven’t overcome. Adaptation and up-gradation are going to be the primary factor for survival. As we witness the onset of the 4th industrial revolution, let’s buckle up our seats and race along the highway with the essential fuels (skills) so as to not let ourselves eliminated. After all, this is an unending race with infinity as the end, all we could do is try not to run out of fuel. Try not to be outdated.\n",

      "What Jobs Will Robots Take From Humans in The Future?\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "AI is rapidly evolving in the employment sector, particularly in matters involving business and finance. Finance, management, economics, and accounting are now among the most popular university courses globally; particularly at the graduate level, due to their high employability. However, the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that. According to research, 230,000 jobs in these sectors may be replaced by AI agents in the next 5 years. This is due to the nature of the work, as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information; which machines excel at. Large, complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by AI-powered computers than by people. Algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans. In such matters involving industrial work, a subsection of artificial intelligence is used; namely, machine learning.\n",
      "Machine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in systems, which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience. It is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programs.\n",
      "Its improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps; which start with the collection of data. This data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an IoT structure. The second and most time-consuming step is cleaning, preparing, and rearranging the data; which involves the recognition of outliers, trends, and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible. The third step consists of formatting data; which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources. Step four is where AI comes into place. Self-service data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them. The data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern. Lastly, the data is divided into two sets: one for training the algorithm and one for analysis.\n",
      "There are three types of machine learning; supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning; which is based on accurately labeled data. The machine is given a collection of information, including the outcome of the operation. The rest of the information is referred to as ‘input features’, which ‘supervises’ the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variants.\n",
      "In the case of unsupervised learning, the machine isn’t given labeled sets of data to be divided into, allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided. Since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities, this method helps with the classifying of such data.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning comprises experience-based learning. Similar to people, they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actions.\n",
      "These variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance, which is elaborated on in the following passages.\n",
      "Machine learning in finance and banking\n",
      "There are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking. The most common place it is used is to detect any frauds. Fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year. The most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger, document forgery, and mortgage fraud.\n",
      "Usually, finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online, and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization. With expanding innovative headway, misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information. Fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules, which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters. Therefore, most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactions.\n",
      "Machine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups. It works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses – like the client’s record history, IP address, area, and so forth.  Depending on the type of exchange taking place, the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decision.\n",
      "Examples of fraud detection software used by banks include Feedzai, Data visor, and Teradata\n",
      "Machine learning is also used in algorithmic trading, portfolio management, loan underwriting, chatbots, and improving customer service.\n",
      "Algorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and pre-modified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value, timing, and volume. An algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. Computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long run.\n",
      "In contrast to human dealers, algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day. Machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices, which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal. Likewise, algorithmic exchanging doesn’t settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings, which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires. The exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activities.\n",
      "In the banking industry, organizations access a large number of shopper information, with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process. Machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring, and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by people.\n",
      "Data scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records, search for interesting special cases, and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection. For instance, the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information, like age, pay, occupation, and the buyer’s credit conduct.\n",
      "The benefits of machine learning\n",
      "As with any form of revolutionary technology, the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages. It’s been observed that upon correct usage, it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior. We’ve also seen several of the largest IT conglomerates, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, introduce Cloud Machine Learning platforms.\n",
      "In terms of business, ML can aid businesses by identifying consumer’s demands and formulate a pattern based on them; allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales. It eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms.  Historical data, a process visualization tool, a flexible analytical environment, and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ML architecture. The input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present, which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor. This eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasks.\n",
      "In the financial sector, machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management, algorithmic trading, loan underwriting, and fraud detection. Chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security, customer support, and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ML in banking. Another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition, which entails a system or program that recognizes objects, people, places, and movements in photos. It identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithms.\n",
      "The downfalls of machine learning\n",
      "With all the benefits of its advancement, machine learning isn’t the most perfect thing. There are several disadvantages which are information acquisition, time and resources and high errors, and wrong interpretations. One of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project. More issues have to do with the fact that AI requires gigantic informational indexes to train on, and these ought to be unbiased, and of good quality. There can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced. Machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy. It also needs huge resources to work. This can mean extra requirements for the computer to work. Another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations. You should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted results.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "There have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come. With excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning, many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines. In countries like Japan, mainly computer programs and AI is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors. From cleaning the house to depositing money in banks, everything is done by AI. However, AI cannot replace humans in the future. Humans have several capabilities which, even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have. These capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving, and human connection. For example, when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection, a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle. A machine’s touch would not be able to soothe a child. Another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it, a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do. Like computers, AI will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less time-consuming. Without humans themselves, there is no future for AI.\n",

      "Will Machine Replace The Human in the Future of Work?\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "“Anything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence – in the form of Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. Nothing else is even in the same league.”\n",
      "–Eliezer Yudkowsky, AI Researcher\n",
      "There’s no denying robots and automation are increasingly part of our daily lives. Just look around the grocery store, or the highway, they are everywhere. This makes us wonder what if AI can replace human intelligence? What can we do to make ourselves relevant tomorrow? Let us try to find the answers to all these questions and more.\n",
      "Let’s first understand what is Artificial Intelligence –\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence or AI basically machines displaying intelligence. This can be seen from a machine playing chess or a robot answering questions on Facebook. Artificial Intelligence can be further broken down into many different types. There are AIs designed to do specific tasks, such as detecting a specific type of cancer. However, there are also AIs that can do multiple tasks, such as driving a car. There are many types of AIs. Among the top, most important fields are Machine Learning or ML, Neural Network, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing or NLP.\n",
      "Machine Learning is the idea of machines being able to prove themselves similar to how a human being learns a new skill. Machine Learning also allows for the optimization of an existing skill. Machine Learning is used in many different fields and one such application is entertainment. Netflix uses Machine Learning to recommend more shows that you can watch based on the shows that you have already seen.\n",
      "Neural Networks are algorithms that are modeled after the human brain. These algorithms think just like we do which can thereby give similar results to what a human being can give. Artificial Neural Networks are used in medical fields to diagnose cancers like lung cancer and prostate cancer.\n",
      "Computer Vision is the idea that computers have visions. This allows them to see things the way human beings do or potentially better than human beings do, depending on the programming, camera used, etc. Computer Vision is used in autonomous vehicles for navigation from one place to another.\n",
      "Natural Language Processing is the idea that computers can listen to what we say. An example of this is Siri. Siri is able to listen to our demands, process what it means, and provide you an answer based on what is researched.\n",
      "Now that we know what an AI is and what it can do, Let’s talk about the issue.\n",
      "AIs allow for the automation of jobs, thereby replacing what humans already do. This means more job loss and the concentration of wealth to the selected few people. This could mean a destabilization of society and social unrest. In addition to social unrest, AI improves over time. This means it becomes smarter, faster, and cheaper to implement and it will be better at doing repetitive things that humans currently do, such as preparing fast food. It is predicted that AI will improve so much over 50 to 100 years that AI will become super intelligent. This means that it will become even smarter than the most intelligent human on earth. According to many experts such as Elon Musk, this could cause the end of human civilization. AI could potentially start a war against humans, burn crops and do all sorts of tragedies once reserved for human functions. At that point, in theory, we can not stop it because AI would have already thought of all the obstacles that will prevent its goal. This means that we cannot unplug the machine, in effect AI will replace human intelligence.\n",
      "But, will this happen in next 10 to 30 years?\n",
      "NO! The field of Artificial Intelligence is sophisticated enough to do many human tasks that humans currently do. Currently, AI is not smart enough to be empathetic to humans and cannot think strategically enough to solve complex problems. AI solutions can be expensive and have to go through many different tests and standards to implement. It also takes time for AI to improve. For example, Boston Dynamics, one of the world’s top robotics company had a robot in 2009 that needed assistance to walk. Fast forward to 2019, not only the robot could walk by itself but it could jump over objects, do backflips and so much more. In addition to the timing, it takes time for the price of any new technological solution to drop to a point where it is affordable. For example, a desktop computer costs around $1000 in 1999 but now you can get a significantly more powerful laptop for the exact same price. AI will go through the same curve.\n",
      "But what happens after those 10 to 30 years? Will AI make human intelligence obsolete? Maybe. As we have proven earlier AI will become faster better and cheaper. As this happens, more and more companies will use AI technology to automate more and more jobs to save money, increase productivity, and most importantly, stay competitive. As we have demonstrated, AI will become better through repetition via the use of machine learning. The only difference is that AI will be able to learn faster as time progresses due to the amount of data that is available today. It will also be able to learn from other machines or similar machines to learn how to optimize its tasks or new important skills. However, AI also just not do repetitive and routine tasks better, it will also be able to understand emotional intelligence, ethics, and creativity. This seen in three distinct example- IBM\n",
      "IBM uses its IBM Watson to program the AI to create a movie trailer. Fox approached IBM and said they have a movie coming out on AI #Scifi horror. They asked IBM if their platform IBM Watson could a trailer by reviewing and watching the footage and searching for scary,\n",
      "Sad or happy or other moments in the movie that provoked quality emotions based on how the machine was programmed to identify such emotions in a quantifiable manner. IBM Watson was able to generate a trailer for the movie Morgan. The result, a movie trailer created by machines example – Google\n",
      "IN 2018 google demonstrated an AI assistance that could take calls and do simple stuff. The AI was able to set up an appointment! What was more fascinating was that it was able to understand the nuances of the conversation. The receptionist thought it was a human being that was calling her. That is a very primitive version of what is possible with this technology. Eventually, it will be able to have conversations just as human beings do, making many sales jobs obsolete. example – AI generated art\n",
      "In 2018, a Paris art collective consisting of three students used artificial intelligence to generate a portrait. It generated the portrait painting by studying a set of fifteen thousand art images on wiki art. It was estimated to be worth between seven thousand to ten thousand dollars. The painting sold at an auction for four thirty-five thousand US dollars.\n",
      "However, we cannot for sure say that AI will replace human intelligence. This is because we as a society have started asking hard questions and questioning ethics. Elon Musk founded Open AI, a research lab whose whole purpose is to promote and discover artificial intelligence in a way to benefits humanity. In addition to this, there are many factors that affect the long-term outcome of AI replacing human intelligence. Like, to what degree will other humans allow for AI to take over? Depending on the field, do people even want Artificial Intelligence to help them? Or will they prefer a human counterpart? While we may not be able to control what happens in the long run, we can definitely secure our short-term future.\n",
      "Strategic and creative thinking\n",
      "The ability to think outside the box is very human. There are thousands upon thousands of slightly different possible outcomes that may result from every distinguishable action that the human mind with its ability to judge from experience is programmed for these purposes in a far more sophisticated manner than AI can currently achieve. As the billionaire founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma famously said – “AI has logic, human beings have wisdom”.\n",
      "Conflict resolution and negotiations\n",
      "With our understanding of the complexities of human-related processes and our ability to improvise and judge, we are far better equipped to deal with conflicts than robots are ever likely to be.\n",
      "AI may be able to recognize faces and images but it can rarely successfully read the feelings of those faces. Humans, to lesser or greater degrees, are capable of an accurate analysis of emotional subtext. With the application of intuition and the use of delicately worded or elusive languages, through these methods, we are able to properly judge how a person feels.\n",
      "Interpretation of Gray Areas\n",
      "Robots and computers function well when presented with quantifiable data. However, once the situation enters a gray area, whether this term refers to morals, processes, or definitions robots are more likely to falter.\n",
      "Critical thinking\n",
      "Humans are capable of responding to more indicators of quality than computers are. While an AI system may be able to analyze documents according to the true or false statements made within the text, we can judge whether or not it is well written and analyze the implication of the use of certain words and the overall meaning of the content.\n",

      "“Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make”\n",
      "Nick Bostrom\n",
      "To put it frankly, Artificial Intelligence will eventually replace jobs. Workers in a variety of industries, from healthcare to agriculture and manufacturing, should expect to witness hiring disruptions as a result of Artificial Intelligence.\n",
      "If history has taught us anything, it is that disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas not only make a fortune for the innovators, but they also build the groundwork for new business models, market entrants, and job opportunities which will inevitably follow. It is true that robots today or in future will eventually replace humans for many jobs, but so did innovative farming equipment for humans and horses during the industrial revolution. But that does not mean that our jobs as humans will end here. We, on the other hand, will be required to generate and provide value in whole new ways for entirely new business models as a result of these changes.\n",
      "According to 71% of the businesses worldwide, Artificial Intelligence can help people overcome critical and challenging problems and live better lives. Artificial Intelligence consultants at work will be more or equally fair, according to a whopping 83% of corporate leaders. These results demonstrate that Artificial Intelligence is steadily extending its measures, yielding societal benefits and allowing citizens to live more fulfilling lives.\n",
      "Since the advent of Industry 4.0, businesses are moving at a fast pace towards automation, be it any type of industry. In 2013, researchers at oxford university did a study on the future of work. They concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines. Machine learning is responsible for this disruption. It is the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence. It allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do.\n",
      "A research was conducted by the employees of Kaggle wherein an algorithm was to be created to take images of a human eye and diagnose an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy. Here, the winning algorithm could match the diagnosis given by human ophthalmologists. Another study was conducted wherein an algorithm should be created to grade high school essays. Here too, the winning algorithm could match the grade given by human teachers.\n",
      "Thus, we can safely conclude that given the right data, machines can easily outperform human beings in tasks like these. A teacher might read 10,000 essays over a 40-year career; an ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes but a machine can read a million essays and see a million eyes within minutes.\n",
      "Thus, it is convenient to conclude that we have no chance of competing with machines on frequent, high volume tasks.\n",
      "Tasks where machines don’t work\n",
      "But there are tasks where human beings have an upper hand, and that is, in novel tasks. Machines can’t handle things they haven’t seen many times before. The fundamental rule of machine learning is that it learns from large volumes of past data. But humans don’t; we have the ability of seemingly connecting disparate threads to solve problems we haven’t seen before.\n",
      "Percy Spencer was a physicist working on radar during world war 2 where he noticed that the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar. Here, he was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent the microwave oven. Now this sort of cross pollination happens to each one of us several times in a day. Thus, machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations.\n",
      "Now as we all know that around 92% of talented professionals believe that soft skills such as human interactions and fostering relationships matter much more than hard skills in being successful in managing a workplace. Perhaps, these are the kind of tasks that machines can never compete with humans at.\n",
      "Also, creative tasks: the copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab customers’ attention and will have to stand out of the crowd. Business strategy means finding gaps in the market and accordingly working on them. Since machines cannot outperform humans in novel tasks, it will be humans who would be creating these campaigns and strategies.\n",
      "Human contact would be essential in care-giving and educational-related work responsibilities, and technology would take a backseat. Health screenings and customer service face-to-face communication would advocate for human contact, with Artificial Intelligence playing a supporting role.\n",
      "So, what does this mean for the future of work? The future state of any single job lies in the answer to one single question: to what extent is the job reducible to tackling frequent high-volume tasks and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations?\n",
      "Today machines diagnose diseases and grade exam papers, over the coming years they’re going to conduct audits, they’re going to read boilerplate from legal contracts. But does that mean we’re not going to be needing accountants and lawyers? Wrong. We’re still going to need them for complex tax structuring, for path breaking litigation. It will only get tougher to get these jobs as machine learning will shrink their ranks.\n",
      "Amazon has recruited more than 100,000 robots in its warehouses to help move goods and products around more effectively, and its warehouse workforce has expanded by more than 80,000 people. Humans pick and pack goods (Amazon has over 480,000,000 products on its “shelves”), while robots move orders throughout the enormous warehouses, therefore reducing “the amount of walking required of workers, making Amazon pickers more efficient and less exhausted.” Furthermore, because Amazon no longer requires aisle space for humans, the robots enable Amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic.” More inventory under one roof offers better selection for customers, and a higher density of shelf space equals more inventory under one roof.\n",
      "Kodak, once an undisputed giant of the photography industry, had a 90% share in the USA market in 1976, and by 1984, they were employing 1,45,000 people. But in the year 2012, they had a net worth of negative $1 billion and they had to declare bankruptcy. Why? Because they failed to predict the importance of exponential trends when it comes to technology. On the other hand, Instagram, a digital photography company started in 2012 with 13 employees and later they were sold to Facebook for $1 billion. This is so ironic because Kodak pioneered digital photography and actually invented the first digital camera but unfortunately thought of it as a mere product and didn’t pay attention towards it and this created the problem.\n",
      "We live in an era of artificial intelligence (AI), which has given us tremendous computing power, storage space, and information access. We were given the spinning wheel in the first, electricity in the second, and computers in the third industrial revolution by the exponential growth of technology.\n",
      "Airbnb, which is a giant start-up and is known for enabling homeowners to rent out their homes and couches to travellers, for example, “is now creating a new Artificial Intelligence system that will empower its designers and product engineers to literally take ideas from the drawing board and convert them into actual products almost instantly.” This might be a significant breakthrough whether you’re a designer, engineer, or other type of technologist.\n",
      "Differences that Automation brings onto the table:\n",
      "There are three key changes that automation can bring about at the macro level:\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence isn’t just a fad. Tractica, a market research firm, published a report in 2016 that predicted “annual global revenue for artificial intelligence products and services will expand from 643.7 million in 2016 to $36.8 billion by 2025, a 57-fold increase over that time span.” As a result, it is the IT industry’s fastest-growing segment of any size.”\n",
      "The reduction in need for people as a result of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies, which resulted in job layoffs, was a cause of fear. In India alone, job losses in the IT sector have reportedly reached 1,000 in the last year, owing to the integration of new and advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n",
      "Most of the IT companies such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Cognizant have reduced their employee base in India and are recruiting less, while engaging more personnel in the United States and investing heavily in “centres of innovation.” Artificial Intelligence and data science, which are currently the trending aspects that require fewer people and are primarily located abroad, aren’t helping the prospects of local employees. Another factor is that the computer industry is continuously growing and would develop to a size of two million workers. Unfortunately, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to what robots are doing to Information Technology’s less-skilled brothers.\n",
      "Large e-commerce sites that used to be operated by armies of people are now manned by 200 robots produced by GreyOrange, which is an Indian company based out in Gurgaon. These indefatigable robots lift and stack boxes 24 hours a day, with only a 30-minute break for recharging, and have cut employees by up to 80%. For efficiency, this is a victory but a disaster for job prospects.\n",
      "Internal re-skilling and redeployment of staff is a critical requirement of the hour. Artificial intelligence has presented Indian policymakers with epistemological, scientific, and ethical issues. This requires us to abandon regular, linear, and non-disruptive mental patterns. The tale of artificial intelligence’s influence on individuals and their occupations will only be told over time. It is up to us to upskill ourselves and look for ways to stay current with the industry’s current trends and demands.\n",
      "So, will machines be able to take over many of our jobs? The answer is a resounding yes. However, for every job that is taken over by robots, there will be an equal number of positions available for people to do. Some of these human vocations will be artistic in nature. Others will necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. Humans and machines can form symbiotic relationships, assisting each other in doing what they do best. In the future, people and machines may be able to collaborate and work together towards a common goal for any business they work for.\n",

      "Will machine replace the human in the future of work?\n",
      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "Where is this disruptive technology taking us? Take it or leave it, disruptive technology always creates new jobs much more than depleted jobs. You might notice certain jobs disappearing but those jobs are the jobs that transform humans to robots, to machines, and the technology is creating machines to replace them.  Technology creates the data analysis tools to manipulate and create custom scenarios using artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict and drive consumer behavior. Data Analytics tools, such as Google Analytics , and others are available today for free, and, if used correctly, can help organizations save millions, maybe billions of dollars of sales and marketing.\n",
      "Before I go on, I think it’s best to level set on what constitutes machines. In the context of this article , machines describe computers and computerized equipment, like robots, that have been programmed to learn, sometimes like humans. Occasionally we call this Artificial Intelligence (AI), other times we call this machine learning, and still other times we call this robotics. And yes, these are technically different things. These bots are more efficient than humans in some specific domains and are growing smarter with each passing day. They can do some really tough tasks which are considered difficult for any human being.  But, within the broad discussion related to the future of work, these are totally interrelated. Factory floors deploy robots that are increasingly driven by machine learning algorithms such that they can adjust to people working alongside them. A machine can work efficiently only it has abundant data and information about the work which is being imparted daily to them. But with every forward step & advancement in technology, a threat is proliferating, a threat of being replaced on our work front. Every passing day is sealing some jobs for humans all over the globe. Similarly, AI is being used to turn hand-drawn sketches (done by humans) into digital source code.\n",
      "Companies are clearly developing their AI and robotics expertise with the idea that through these technological innovations they’ll be able to\n",
      "Of course, it’s not just machines and creatives working together either. In another example, Amazon has employed more than 100,000 robots in its warehouses to efficiently move things around while it has increased its warehouse workforce by more than 80,000. Humans, in Amazon’s case, do the picking and packing of goods while robots move orders around the giant warehouses, essentially cutting “down on the walking required of workers, making Amazon pickers more efficient and less tired.” Plus, the robots “allow Amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic because they no longer need aisle space for humans. The greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof, which means better selection for customers.”\n",
      "During the next few decades (or maybe sooner), the notion of work and whether it is handled by a human or a virtual being will hinge on predictability. As they are starting to do today, machines will manage the routine while humans take on the unpredictable – tasks that require creativity, problem-solving, and flexibility. In this context, robotics should be seen not only as a means to improve operations efficiency but also to improve the quality of life for workers.\n",
      "Although it is obvious that human factors involved in a work activity impact job automation, it is also true that highly repetitive tasks—and even mechanical ones—are ideal for robots. Besides greater efficiency and speed, automation leads to a lower risk of accidents, greater control and autonomy, and above all, fewer costs for organizations.\n",
      "Although artificial intelligence and machine learning make us believe that robots are endowed with superior intelligence, in fact they don’t yet have the ability to learn from experience and to respond to unknowns. So as things stand, however much processing speed and automatic learning a robot has, it doesn’t beat factors innate to the human brain. Humans are still a very essential part of the process. Think about delivering services to a client. Most customer challenges are routine, but humans play a very important role in addressing new issues, solving them the first time they appear, and then consolidating the process into the system.\n",
      "While machines and humans are placed in proximity,  robots can be expensive, but this doesn’t apply to all types, especially those based on Robotic Process Automation (RPA), where the development process incorporates algorithms that significantly reduce costs.\n",
      "Moreover, think of how domestic robots—be it a vacuum cleaner, a lawn mower or a pool cleaner—are increasingly part of our daily lives. This level of consumption that robotics has attained makes it affordable to automate tasks in modern homes to obtain greater control, security and comfort.\n",
      "The division between humans and machines has been clear – I’m here, the machine is there – but that boundary is getting fuzzier. Smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly with our bodies, making up for lost limbs or providing additional strength, stability, or resilience, as seen in exoskeletons donned by assembly line workers.\n",
      "We use our smartphones symbiotically, but what if they were integrated directly into our bodies? Think a smartphone in the form of a contact lens capable of transparently delivering augmented reality images straight to the brain. Think it sounds like science fiction? Think again. The first prototypes have already been built.\n",
      "Soon, brain-computer interfaces could become seamless as well, creating a new synergistic relationship between the cloud and us. At that point, the question of who knows what would be moot; you ask me a question and I know the answer. Sometimes that answer will be stored in my own neural circuitry, but most of the time it would come from the connection of my neurons to the web. Our brain’s decision process is influenced by the way it has been “educated” by the cultural context. These external factors are influencing our decision processes to the point that in certain situations, we can legitimately claim that influence has been so strong that our brains can’t be held accountable for the choices made. The point I’m trying to make is that we humans are in symbiosis with our cultural environment and the tools – both physical and conceptual – that we have been taught to use. My guess is that the transformation will be subtle.\n",
      "Practically speaking, robots growing to the point that they take over the world and then start creating smarter, better robots are impractical and should not even be a concern. None of this is expected in the near future, not by a long shot. If you’ve been to an ATM, waited for a PC to boot up after a catastrophic failure, or had a game crash on your X box just when you were about to reach a checkpoint, you understand that we are not in a world where machines do everything perfectly right. Before they can take over all of our jobs, they need to be able to do theirs’ flawlessly; until then, we can depend on humans to mess up our lives.\n",
      "This isn’t a win-or-lose situation. We’re going to wind up as a partner to our smarter machines, and that partnership will be fostered by our augmentation through technology. Machines will play an essential role in this augmentation and, as with any successful technology, they will fall below our level of perception. In the end, the revolution will be silent and invisible.\n",

      "Text of the URL :\n",
      "In future or in upcoming years humans and machines are going to work together in every field of work. In upcoming days machines will be the need for every human being. Machines [AI technology] will do the work which humans are incapable of doing. Machines will partner and co-operate with humans.\n",
      "According to the professor at the university of Washington, he explained that, as a result of AI, there will be more demand for existing jobs and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today. Human workers and machines will work together flawlessly, complementing each other. Machines will learn to carry out easier tasks such as following processes or crunching data. They will also help the humans while difficult. Machines or AI will create a great job opportunities for humans in future. John Kelly ll, executive vice president of IBM once said that “Man and Machines working together always beat or make a better decision than a man or a machine independently.”\n",
      "In future, the three sectors of our country like agriculture sector, industrial sector and service sector are going to utilize the machines. So, that their work becomes not difficult. As of now, we can only see that for agriculture purposes various kinds of machines are used which we called as a modern farming method. Some major technologies [machines] that are harvest automation, autonomous tractors, seeding, and weeing and drones. As a result, farms can do agriculture peacefully. In the industrial sector also humans and machines are working together to increase production. Various types of machines are used in industries such as packing machines, loading machine etc. humans provide instructions to the machines and maintain the management in the company. Soon robots [machines] will assist doctors with surgeries. For instance, a doctor at remote location could direct a surgical robot to perform an open heart surgery. But the approaches option and decision will be left to experience and wisdom of the doctor not the robot.\n",
      "What do you think of machines if they will make humans less or more in the field? Machines will push human professionals up the skillset ladder into uniquely human skills such as creativity, social abilities, empathy, and sense-making, which machines cannot automate. As a result, machines will make the workplace more, not less for humans. However, humans have to learn new skills throughout their lives. It is said that in the future 80% of process-oriented tasks will be done by machines. Quantitative reasoning tasks will be done approximately 50% by humans and 50% by machines, while humans will continue to do more than 80% of cross-functional reasoning tasks. According to Harvard research machines, algorithms can read diagnostic scans with 92% accuracy. Humans can do it with 96% accuracy. Together, it will be 99% accurate.\n",
      "Human-machine collaboration enables companies to interact with employees and customers in the novel, more effective ways. Smart machines are helping humans to expand their abilities in three ways. They can amplify our cognitive strengths; interact with customers and employees to free us from higher-level tasks, and embody human skills to extend our physical capabilities. In the research, it was found that 1,500 companies achieve the most significant performance improvement when humans and machines work together. New machine systems have beyond-human cognitive abilities, which many of us fear could potentially dehumanize the future of work. Machines will indeed automate most repetitive and physical tasks, and part of quantitative tasks such as programming and even data science. According to D.E Shaw Group and professor at the University of Washington, explained that, as a result of machines, there will be more demand for existing jobs, and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today. This is similar to how we couldn’t imagine a web app developer decades ago, and now millions make a living doing that today.\n",
      "Machines are good at doing tasks with speed, precision, and accuracy. But machines are not very good at responding to unknown situations or making judgments. That part will be left to humans. Hence, the need for both humans and machines will be there in the future. Humans and machines have divergent skill sets that, when combined can transform the way we work. Machines have already infiltrated every aspect of our lives, and we must learn to live with them. In the future, human workers will interact more closely with humans.\n",
